			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Schema.org [[schema-org]] is described as a <q>collaborative, community activity with a mission to
					create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data.</q> Of particular importance is that it
				includes the following set of accessibility properties for describing creative works:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessMode">accessMode</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient">accessModeSufficient</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature">accessibilityFeature</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard">accessibilityHazard</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary">accessibilitySummary</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>These properties are key to the discoverability of EPUB publications and are central to the requirements
				of the EPUB Accessibility standard [[epub-a11y]]. They are also used to generate accessibility
				statements about a publication, as described in the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/metadata-display-guide/guidelines/">Accessibility Metadata
					Display Guide for Digital Publications</a>.</p>

			<p>To provide maximum value for readers, the metadata needs to be consistent, which is where the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/">Schema.org Accessibility Properties for
					Discoverability Vocabulary</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] comes in. This vocabulary defines controlled
				sets values to use with each property (with the exception of summaries, which are free-form text).</p>

			<p>But even with a controlled vocabulary, as schema.org is intended to describe any resource on or
				referenced from the web, the value definitions do not always fully reflect how to apply them to EPUB
				publications. That is where this guide fits in. Its goal is add clarity on how to apply the metadata to
				both reflowable and fixed-layout EPUB publications.</p>

			<h2>Access modes</h2>

			<section id="accessmode-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>An access mode is defined as a "human sense perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a
					user may process or perceive the content of a digital resource." [[iso24751-3]] For example, if an
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> contains images
					and video, visual perception is required to consume the content exactly as it was created.</p>

				<p>There are four access modes that are typically specified for EPUB publications:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><strong>textual</strong> — the publication contains text content (headings, paragraphs,
							etc.).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>visual</strong> — the publication contains visual content such as images, graphics,
							diagrams, animations, and video.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>auditory</strong> — the publication contains auditory content such as standalone
							audio clips and audio soundtracks for video content.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><strong>tactile</strong> — the publication contains tactile content such as embedded braille
							and tactile diagrams.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="accessmode-general">
				<h3>General application guidelines</h3>

				<p>Access modes are set in the [[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"
							><code>accessMode</code> property</a>. Repeat the property for each access mode.</p>

				<p>For a user to determine whether an EPUB publication is suitable for their needs, they need to know
					which access modes are required to consume the content. List all applicable access modes in the
						[[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><code>accessMode</code> property</a>,
					repeating the property for each applicable mode.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for textual and visual access modes">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p><strong>Do not</strong> list access modes for content that does not contain information necessary to
					understand a publication. Most EPUB publications contain cover images, for example, but it is not
					necessary to see the cover image to read the publication. The same is true of publisher logos and
					images in the content are only for presentational purposes (i.e., have no information so have empty
					[[html]] <code>alt</code> attribute values). If these are the only visual content, then it is not
					valid to list a visual access mode. Similarly, if the only audio an EPUB publication contains is
					background music (e.g., for an instructional video with text captions, or as mood music while
					reading), listing an auditory access mode is not valid.</p>

				<p>Note that the access modes of the content do not reflect any adaptations that have been provided. For
					example, if a comic book also includes alternative text for each image, it does not have a textual
					access mode. See the following section on <a href="#accessModeSufficient">sufficient access
						modes</a> for how to indicate that the available adaptations allow the content to be consumed in
					another mode.</p>

				<section id="accessMode-sync">
					<h4>Synchronized text and audio</h4>

					<p>Setting the correct access modes and sufficient access modes for EPUB 3 publications that contain
						synchronized text-audio playback requires evaluating whether playback is essential to reading
						the publication or an additional feature.</p>

					<p>EPUB 3's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays</a> [[epub-3]]
						allows EPUB creators to synchronize the full text of a publication with full audio narration.
						These types of publications are commonly referred to as "read aloud" books, as the user chooses
						whether or not to turn on the narration (unlike traditional audiobooks where only the audio is
						available).</p>

					<p>In this case, because the audio playback is an extra feature, EPUB creators would
							<strong>not</strong> list "<code>auditory</code>" as an <a href="#accessMode">access
							mode</a>. Rather, they would indicate the presence of text and audio synchronization as an
							<a href="#accessMode-sync">accessibility feature</a>:</p>

					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   synchronizedAudioText
&lt;/meta></pre>

					<p>Although the audio is not essential to reading the publication, having full audio playback
						capability means that there is an auditory <a href="#accessModeSufficient">sufficient access
							mode</a> &#8212; the user can listen to the complete publication. Consequently, the EPUB
						creator would declare a <code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> property with the value
							<code>auditory</code>:</p>

					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   auditory
&lt;/meta></pre>

					<div class="note">
						<p>When media overlays are present, EPUB creators should not add "<code>auditory</code>" to all
							the possible sufficient access modes just because it is possible to turn on text-audio
							playback.</p>

						<p>For example, a publication with media overlays that has text and images (with text
							alternatives) would only declare the following sufficient access modes:
								"<code>textual</code>", "<code>auditory</code>", and "<code>textual,visual</code>".</p>

						<p>It would <strong>not</strong> declare "<code>textual,auditory</code>" or
								"<code>textual,visual,auditory</code>".</p>
					</div>

					<p>Another use for media overlays &#8212; more typical among accessible republishers such as
						libraries that serve blind and low vision readers &#8212; is to provide full audio synchronized
						to the major headings of a publication. These types of publications are more like traditional
						audiobooks, as all the information in the work is typically available in auditory form. The
						minimal text does not allow meaningful visual reading or text-to-speech playback; it is only to
						provide structured navigation capabilities.</p>

					<p>In this case, being able to hear the audio is essential to being able to read the publication, so
						EPUB creators will list an auditory access mode:</p>

					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   auditory
&lt;/meta></pre>

					<p>In a reverse of the first case discussed, EPUB creators will <strong>not</strong> identify
						text-audio synchronization as a feature of the publication since the amount of text provided is
						trivial.</p>

					<p>Likewise, since the text in the publication only provides heading navigation, EPUB creators will
							<strong>not</strong> list a textual access mode. The user does not need to, and is not
						expected to, visually read this text.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Some publications that provide the body in auditory form may include the backmatter in text
							form, allowing users to use text-to-speech playback to render it. In this case, there would
							be a textual component.</p>

			<h2>Sufficient access modes</h2>

			<section id="ams-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>The access modes sufficient to consume an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication"
						>EPUB publication</a> express a broader picture of the potential usability than do the <a
						href="#accessMode">basic access modes</a>. Where the basic access modes identify the default
					nature of the media used in the publication, sufficient access modes identify all the individual
					modes, and sets of modes, that allow a user to read a publication. Sufficient access modes account
					for the affordances and adaptations that the EPUB creators have provided, allowing users to
					determine whether they can the read content regardless of its default nature.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="ams-general">
				<h3>General application guidelines</h3>

				<p>Sufficient access modes are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"><code>accessModeSufficient</code> property</a>.
					Repeat the property for each set of sufficient access modes.</p>

				<p>The most strongly recommended sufficient access modes to list are the ones that consist of only a
					single value. Users seeking alternatives to the default encoding of the information typically want
					to read the content without switching reading modes (e.g., they want a purely textual alternative to
					use text-to-speech playback or an auditory alternative to listen to prerecorded narration). Listing
					the single value sets allows users to easily determine whether a publication will meet their reading
					needs.</p>

				<p>The most common single sufficient access modes for EPUB publications are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>textual</code> &#8212; setting this value indicates that the publication is screen-reader
						friendly (i.e., all the content is available for text-to-speech rendering by an assistive
						technology). EPUB creators can set this value for EPUB publications that conform to <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1_A">Level A</a> [[wcag2]] or higher, for example, as
						there must be textual alternatives for non-text content to meet these thresholds.</li>
					<li><code>auditory</code> &#8212; setting this value indicates that pre-recorded audio is available
						for the publication. EPUB creators can set this value for EPUB publications that provide media
						overlays for all the content.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>As an example of setting sufficient access modes, consider an EPUB publication that contains graphics
					and charts, as well as descriptions for all these images. The publication has both textual and
					visual content, so the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creator</a> will
					include the following <code>schema:accessMode</code> metadata entries to indicate this:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>This metadata does not make clear whether a textual access mode is sufficient to read the entire
					publication, or whether a visual one is, only that the user requires the ability to read in those
					two modes by default. This discrepancy is why sufficiency is also important to know.</p>

				<p>Since the EPUB creator has also included textual alternatives and/or descriptions for all the images
					in the example publication, the metadata can also indicate that a purely textual access mode is
					sufficient to read the content:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Without this metadata, users would not have known that they could read the publication only via its
					textual content.</p>

				<p>It is important to emphasize when listing individual values in the
						<code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> property not to simply restate each individual access
					mode. When adding a <code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> property with only a single value,
						<strong>all information</strong> in the publication must be available in that mode.</p>

				<p>For example, the EPUB creator would not declare a sufficient access mode of "<code>visual</code>" for
					the example publication as the information is not entirely available in image-based form. (Photo
					books without text would be examples of works with a purely visual sufficient access mode.)</p>

				<p>EPUB creators may also list any sets of sufficient access modes that allow full access to the
					information. As the most typical set of values is the combination of all the access modes, however,
					the information this provides users is less helpful in determining the usability of a
					publication.</p>

				<p>For example, the metadata the EPUB creator inputs for the example publication re-establishes that
					there is a textual and visual reading option:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The order in which EPUB creators list the access modes in a set is not important. The only
						requirement is to separate the values by commas.</p>
				</div>


				<p>The complete set of <code>schema:accessMode</code> and <code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code>
					entries for the example publication is as follows:</p>

				<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>

				<p>Note that sufficiency of access is often a subjective determination of the EPUB creator based on
					their understanding of what information is essential to comprehending the text. Some information
					loss occurs by not being able to view a video, for example, but the EPUB creator might regard the
					visual or auditory losses as inconsequential if a transcript provides all the necessary information
					to understand the concepts being conveyed.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The <code>accessModeSufficient</code> property, as defined in [[schema-org]], allows more

				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>Identifying all the accessibility features and adaptations included in an <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> allows users to
					determine whether the content is usable at a more fine-grained level than the access modes do.</p>

				<p>For example, a math textbook might have a textual access mode, but that alone does not indicate
					whether MathML markup is available. Whether a visual work only provides alternative text or whether
					it includes extended descriptions is also important to know when gauging its usability.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="features-general">
				<h3>General application guidelines</h3>

				<p>Accessibility features are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"><code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a>.
					Repeat this property for each feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for MathML and alternative text">

   MathML
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta

				</aside>

				<p>The EPUB format requires that some accessibility features will always be present (e.g., a table of
					contents). Do not exclude these features from the accessibility metadata, as users typically are not
					aware what features are built into a format. Failing to include entries will reduce the
					discoverability of the publication when users search for specific features.</p>

				<p>Be aware that although the vocabulary for the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature"
							><code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] contains the values
						"<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#feature-none"><code>none</code></a>"
					and "<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#feature-unknown"
							><code>unknown</code></a>", these terms cannot be used to meet the reporting requirements
					for the property. Authors must indicate at least one feature that is not one of these values to

						characteristics without having to parse or interpret the structure of the content.</p>

					<p>For ease of reading, this section splits the vocabulary into the following distinct groups:</p>

					<p><a href="#structure-navigation-terms">Structure and Navigation Terms</a> identify navigation aids
						that are provided to simplify moving around within the media, such as the inclusion of a table
						of contents or an index.</p>

					<p><a href="#adaptation-terms">Adaptation Terms</a> identify content features that provide alternate
						access to a resource. The inclusion of alternative text in an [[HTML]] alt attribute is one of the
						most commonly identifiable augmentation features.</p>

					<p><a href="#rendering-control-terms">Rendering Control Terms</a> identify content rendering
						features that users have access to or can control. The ability to modify the appearance of the
						text is one example.</p>

					<p><a href="#specialized-markup-terms">Specialized Markup Terms</a> identify that content is encoded
						using domain-specific grammars like MathML and LaTeX that can provide users a richer reading
						experience.</p>

					<p><a href="#clarity-terms">Clarity Terms</a> identify ways that the content has been enhanced for
						clearer readability. Audio with minimized background noise is one example, while content
						formatted for large print reading is another.</p>

					<p><a href="#tactile-terms">Tactile Terms</a> identify content that is formatted for tactile use,
						such as graphics and objects.</p>

					<p><a href="#i18n-terms">Internationalization Terms</a> identify those accessibility characteristics

						<h5>Reading Order</h5>

						<p>The reading order of the content is clearly defined in the markup (e.g., figures, sidebars
							and other secondary content has been marked up to allow it to be skipped automatically
							and/or manually escaped from.</p>

						<p>Add this metadata of <code>readingOrder</code> only when the accessible reading order matches
							the visual layout reading order.</p>

						<p>An example when this would not be the case is a two page spread where the intent is to
							visually read across the page boundary, since AT would read down the first page and then
							continue reading down the 2nd page.</p>

						<h5>Structural Navigation</h5>

						<p>The metadata <code>structuralNavigation</code> is used to indicate that an EPUB document has
							been structured to support accessible navigation through its content. This is crucial for
							users of assistive technologies.</p>

						<p>The use of headings, lists, tables, asides, etc. in the resource fully and accurately
							reflects the document hierarchy, allowing navigation by assistive technologies.</p>

						<p>You should use this metadata when your document meets the following criteria:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><b>Semantic Structure</b>: The document uses semantic HTML5 elements that accurately
								represent the content's logical structure.</li>
							<li><b>Heading Hierarchy</b>: Headings (h1-h6) are used in a meaningful, hierarchical manner
								that reflects the document's outline.</li>
							<li><b>Navigational Elements</b>: The document includes: <ul>
									<li>Properly nested headings</li>
									<li>Ordered and unordered lists where appropriate</li>
									<li>Tables with appropriate headers and captions</li>
									<li>Semantic elements like section, article, aside, etc.</li>
									<li>Meaningful landmark roles</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Benefits of Structural Navigation:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Enables screen readers to provide better navigation</li>
							<li>Allows users to jump between sections easily</li>
							<li>Provides a clear, logical understanding of the document's structure</li>
							<li>Improves overall accessibility and usability</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The metadata to include in the package document when proper structural elements are used to
							facility accessible navigation would be:</p>

                                    The vertical axis represents revenue in millions of dollars, ranging from 0 to 50 million.

                                    showing a significant recovery and growth after the initial impact of the global pandemic.
                                    The 2022 bar reaches the highest point at 45 million dollars,
                                    demonstrating the most successful year in the company's recent history.

                    <p>Indicates that the EPUB contains synchronized pre-recorded audio narration that matches the text of the document, commonly known as a Media Overlay. The reading system can highlight units of text as they are spoken.</p>

                                <p>This indicates that the content is presented in its standard format for languages that do not typically use spaces between words (e.g., Japanese, Chinese, Thai).

                                    <p>This feature represents the default authoring practice for these languages. The text is written as a continuous run of characters within its container element (like a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag) without any special markup to delineate word boundaries.

                        <p><b>Reasoning:</b> EPUB and PDF are fundamentally different technologies. An EPUB's accessibility is achieved through its use of semantic HTML and ARIA, while a PDF's accessibility relies on its internal tagging structure. An EPUB's metadata must describe the features of the EPUB itself. Applying a PDF-specific property like <code>taggedPDF</code> is inappropriate and would be ignored by reading systems.

			<h2>Accessibility hazards</h2>

			<section id="hazards-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>There are three widely recognized hazards that can affect readers of digital content:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>flashing — if a resource flashes more than three times a second, it can cause seizures (e.g.,
							videos and animations). See also <a data-cite="wcag2#seizures-and-physical-reactions"
								>Guideline 2.3</a> [[wcag2]].</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>motion simulation — if a resource simulates motion, it can cause a user to become nauseated
							(e.g., a video game drawn on the [[html]] <a data-lt="canvas"
								><code>canvas</code> element</a> or parallax scrolling with CSS).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>sound — certain sound patterns, such as ringing and buzzing, can cause seizures, while loud
							or sudden changes in volume can also negatively affect users.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-creator">EPUB creators</a> have to report whether their
						<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> contain
					resources that present any of these hazards to users, as they can have real physical effects.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>What precisely constitutes a sound hazard, and how to test for these hazards, is not standardized
						as of publication of this document. EPUB creators will have to use their discretion on when to
						specify a sound hazard until additional guidance is developed. This technique will be updated
						whenever there is more clarity on this issue.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="hazards-general">
				<h3>General application guidelines</h3>

				<p>Hazards are identified in the [[schema-org]] <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"
							><code>accessibilityHazard</code> property</a>. Repeat this property for each hazard.</p>

				<p>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed both positively and
					negatively. This design decision was made because users most often search for content that is free
					from hazards that affect them, but also want to know what dangers are present in any publications
					they discover. To indicate that hazards are not present, use the values
						"<code>noFlashingHazard</code>", "<code>noMotionSimulationHazard</code>", and
						"<code>noSoundHazard</code>".</p>

				<p>Do not skip reporting hazards just because an EPUB publication does not contain any content that
					could present risks. Users cannot infer a meaning when no metadata is present. The value
						"<code>none</code>" can be used in such cases instead of repeating each non-hazard. When the
						"<code>none</code>" value is used, no other hazards values may be specified.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB publication contains a hazard, provide additional information about its source and nature
					in the <a href="#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a>.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB creator cannot determine if a publication presents a specific hazard for users, list that
					hazard as unknown. The following values are used to identify individual unknown hazards:
						"<code>unknownFlashingHazard</code>", "<code>unknownMotionSimultationHazard</code>", and
						"<code>unknownSoundHazard</code>".</p>

				<p>For example, determining whether sound hazards are present can be challenging as the causes are
					currently not well defined. In this case, EPUB creators may prefer to set the
						"<code>unknownSoundHazard</code>" value, as in the following example.</p>

				<p>If it is not possible to determine any hazards, the value "<code>unknown</code>" can be used in place
					of setting the individual hazards to unknown. This value should be used sparingly, however, as it is
					of no value to users. EPUB creators should make every effort to determine if hazards are present.
					When the "<code>unknown</code>" value is set, no other hazard values may be specified.</p>

				<p>EPUB creators must ensure that information about all three types of hazards is included when not
					using the "<code>unknown</code>" or "<code>none</code>" values.</p>

				<p>Refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityHazard">The
							<code>accessibilityHazard</code> Property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] for more information
					about this property and its values.</p>

			<h2>Accessibility summary</h2>

			<section id="summary-overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>An accessibility summary provides a brief, human-readable description of the accessibility
					characteristics of an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publication</a> that cannot be expressed through the other discovery metadata.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="summary-general">
				<h3>General application guidelines</h3>

				<p>An accessibility summary is provided using the [[schema-org]] <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary"
					><code>accessibilitySummary</code> property</a>.</p>

				<p>The accessibility summary should not simply repeat the conformance information provided in the
						<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property, for example, or the features listed in the
						<code>schema:accessibilityFeature</code> properties. When other accessibility metadata is
					present in the package document, systems that process EPUB publications can already present it to
					users. Repeating it in the summary only makes them hear the information again.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary that complements the conformance statement">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="dcterms:conformsTo">
   EPUB Accessibility 1.1 - WCAG 2.1 Level AA
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
   In addition to the requirements of its conformance claim,
   this publication includes sign language interpretation
   for all audio content.&#8230;
&lt;/meta>
					</pre>
				</aside>

				<p>EPUB creators should not include an accessibility summary when they have nothing more to add to the
					conformance claim and other discovery metadata.</p>

				<p>If an EPUB publication does not meet the requirements for content accessibility in [[epub-a11y-111]],
					the reason(s) it fails should be noted in the summary. Similarly, if an EPUB creator is hesitant to
					make a formal claim of conformance, the reasons why can be explained in the summary.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Accessibility summary for a publication that fails the content accessibility requirements">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
   The publication is missing alternative text for complex diagrams.
   The publication otherwise meets WCAG 2.0 Level A.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary for a publication with a motion simulation hazard">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
   Although this publication meets the requirements of its accessibility
   claim, the publication contains a motion hazard in chapter 8 page 202., which could cause motion sickness in certain individuals. There is a video showing a rollercoaster going up and down rapidly. Watching the video is interesting, but not essential for understanding the concept of elevation loss and gain.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>
				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary for a publication with a conformance nuance and additional details">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
This publication strives to meet accepted Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at the AA level. Subject experts were used to create the ALT text. A comprehensive index is included with links to the top of the page.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>


				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary for a publication that used AI for the generation of alt text">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
	AI was used to generate the alt text without review by people familiar with the material.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>


				<aside class="example" title="Accessibility summary for a publication where experts used AI to assist in the generation of alt text ">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilitySummary">
	People familiar with the material used AI to assist in the generation of Alt text.
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>


				<p>Do not repeat this property to provide translations of a summary. EPUB does not define a method for
					including translations. Putting different <code>xml:lang</code> attributes on properties does not
					indicate a translation and could lead to wrong summary being rendered to users.</p>

			<h2>Accessibility APIs</h2>

			<p>It is not necessary to set the <code>schema:accessibilityAPI</code> property for <a

			<h2>Accessible Control</h2>

			<p>It is not necessary to set the <code>schema:accessibilityControl</code> property for <a

				not differentiate issues arising from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-reading-system"
