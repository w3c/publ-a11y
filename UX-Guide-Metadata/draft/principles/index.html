			<p>Finding, buying, and finally reading a publication is a very personal experience. For most of us this is
				routine. We go to a bookstore, search for the title we are interested in or perhaps browse the best
				sellers list, then purchase and start reading the publication.</p>

			<p>Now consider you are blind and rely on an assistive technology to read the publication. You wonder: will
				my screen reader work with this title; are there image descriptions that will be spoken to describe
				these images; are there page numbers which are accessible; is the reading order correct so I don't hear
				a <q>caution</q> after reading a paragraph which could be dangerous? These are just a few of the
				accessibility concerns consumers have when trying to purchase and ultimately read a digital
				publication.</p>

			<p>The good news is more and more publishers are creating publications that are Born Accessible (i.e.,
				accessible from the outset, not fixed later) and getting the accessibility validation or audit done by
				independent organizations.</p>

			<p>This document proposes a shared framework for presenting publication accessibility metadata in a
				user-friendly manner, so as to offer the information to end users in a way that is easy for them to understand (even to the less technical) and consistent across different publications and different digital catalogs.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="general-overview">
			<h2>General overview</h2>

			<p>This document helps those who wish to render accessibility metadata directly to users understand how to
				represent machine-readable accessibility metadata in a user-friendly User Interface / User Experience
				(UI/UX).</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>This document presents high-level principles without going into technical issues related to the
					different metadata standards in the publishing industry.</p>
				<p>Therefore, <a href="#techniques">techniques are available</a> that illustrate to developers how to
					retrieve data to show the information outlined in this document.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Metadata found either inside a digital publication or in a corresponding external record may have
				important accessibility information that helps end users find and determine if the publication can meet
				their specific accessibility needs.</p>

			<p>All accessibility metadata is meant to be machine-readable â€“ apart from the accessibility summary - in this way accessibility metadata can be extracted and displayed uniformly across different publications and localized to different user interface languages.</q></p>

			<p>The accessibility summary was intended (in EPUB Accessibility 1.0) to describe in human-readable
				prose the accessibility features present in the publication as well as any shortcomings. 
				Starting in  EPUB Accessibility 1.1 the accessibility summary became a human-readable summary of the accessibility that complements, but does not duplicate, the other discoverability metadata.</p>

			<p>This document offers guidance on how to aggregate and display metadata to end users; these are not strict guidelines, but suggestions for providing a consistent experience for users through different portals. Different implementers may choose to implement these guidelines a slightly different way, some examples can be seen in the <a href="#implementations">Implementations</a> section of the document.</p>
			
			<section id="techniques">
				<h3>Metadata techniques</h3>

				<p>To assist developers in implementing these guidelines, in-depth notes are available to explain how to
					extract information from publishing industry metadata standards.</p>

				<p>At the time of publishing this document the available techniques for metadata standards are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><p><a href="../techniques/epub-metadata/index.html">EPUB Accessibility Metadata</a></p></li>
					<li><p><a href="../techniques/onix-metadata/index.html">ONIX Accessibility Metadata</a></p></li>

			<h2>Key accessibility information</h2>

			<div class="note">
				<p>When a publisher does not provide any accessibility metadata for a publication, a statement should be
					displayed to the user informing them that no information was supplied.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="note">
				<p>This document does not define the order in which to show the key accessibility information; each implementer can decide the preferred order for showing the accessibility information that follows.</p>

			<section id="supports-nonvisual-reading">
				<h3>Supports nonvisual reading</h3>

				<p>Indicates whether all content required for comprehension can be consumed in text and therefore is
					fully available to assistive technologies and reading systems using text-to-speech or electronic braille functionality.</p>
<div class="note"> <p>The term "electronic braille" and "refreshable braille" are used interchangeably, which denotes a device with pop-up pins to present the braille on a tactile screen.</p></div>
				<p>This field answers whether nonvisual reading is possible, not possible, or unknown.</p>

				<p>Digital publications with essential content included in non-textual form (such as graphs, tables or
					equations presented as images, videos, etc.) must include textual alternatives to ensure that users
					reading with other senses than sight (mainly auditory and tactile) have access to the same
					information as visual readers. These textual alternatives can include extended descriptions,
					transcripts, captions, etc. depending on the nature of the nonvisual content.</p>

				<h3>Pre-recorded audio</h3>

				<p>Indicates the presence of pre-recorded audio and specifies if this audio is standalone (an
					audiobook), accompanies text (embedded audio and video clips), or represents an alternative to the
					text (synchronized text-audio playback).</p>

				<p>Audiobooks created for mainstream use provide important access for many users with disabilities even
					though they are not accessible to all. As they grow in popularity, audiobooks may provide more
					accessibility options in the future.</p>

				<p>Some publications provide audio (including in video) in addition to text. In this case, it is
					important that the user gets informed as they may not be able to access all content in the book. </p>

				<p>Some publications provide pre-recorded audio with text synchronization. They are known for providing
					rich accessibility as pre-recorded audio normally has fewer pronunciation errors than
					computer-generated speech. Users with hearing impairments still can access the full content of these
					books.</p>

				<p>This field answers whether visual adjustments are possible, not possible, or unknown.</p>

				<p>Readers with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities need the ability to change the color of
					text and its background (contrast), the font family and font size used, as well as spacing between
					letters, words, sentences, or paragraphs.</p>

				<p><!--this one might be moved to the technics-->Knowing that a publication can reflow to fit the
					reading system's display area is not sufficient to know that modifications to the font, spacing, and

					essential for accessibility and very important for all users reading publications. Therefore,
					clearly communicating to the user what navigation features are available in the publication is
					important to enable proper selection.</p>

				<p>Note that the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standard requires that <q>[m]ore than

				<h3>Hazards</h3>

				<p>Identifies any potential hazards (e.g., flashing elements, background sounds, and motion simulation)
					that could afflict physiologically sensitive users.</p>

				<p>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed either positively or
					negatively. This is because users search for content that is safe for them as well as want to know

			<section id="conformance-group">
				<h3>Conformance</h3>

				<p>Identifies whether the digital publication meets internationally recognized conformance requirements

				<p>Conformance metadata often uses terminology that most people will not understand, and therefore <a
						href="#conf-statements">simple statements</a> should be provided when EPUB accessibility and
					WCAG levels are identified.</p>

				<p>If a publication identifies that there are accessibility problems, the statement should indicate that
					there are known accessibility limitations. If the publication does not include a conformance claim,
					the statement should indicate that conformance could not be determined. </p>

				<p>In most cases, people will want to know more about the conformance and certification of the

				<aside class="note">
					<p>In cases where the publication's compliance with accessibility standards is unknown, or it has
						known accessibility problems, it may be important for local legislation (e.g., the European

			<h2>Discovering accessible content</h2>

			<p>The guidelines for presenting accessibility metadata detailed in this document are intended to improve
				the user experience when readers browse the catalog entry for a publication. However, accessibility
				metadata also has a vital role to play in helping readers discover publications that are accessible for
				them. Publication providers, such as vendors and libraries, are encouraged to create searching and
				filtering tools that interpret accessibility metadata to aid in discovery. (A full discussion of search
				and filtering issues is out of scope for this document, but this section provides some guidance until
				further research can be carried out.)</p>

			<p>While every user has different accessibility needs, meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
				(WCAG) 2.0 requirements, even at level A, is a baseline that ensures a publication will be widely
				accessible. Publication providers may therefore wish to create specific search capabilities to permit
				users to find publications that have declared conformance to WCAG at any level. We suggest the creation
				of an "Accessible" search filter that only returns publications with metadata that indicates conformance
				to the user-selected WCAG Level &#8212; A, AA, or AAA.</p>

			<p>Publications with full audio created for mainstream use provide important access for many users with
				disabilities even though they are not accessible to all. (Note that these publications differ from
				traditional audiobooks in that the audio accompanies the full or partial text of the publication.)
				Publication providers may already have search tools aimed at finding traditional audiobooks, since they
				are popular and common, but even if not, this would be a good addition to the suite of tools for finding
				accessible publications. Publications with full audio may not pass WCAG requirements, however, because
				they are targeted at a specific audience rather than broadly accessible. As a result, they would not be
				found using the <q>Accessible</q> search suggested above.</p>

			<p>Any of the metadata fields discussed in detail below could also be used as a filter &#8212; a
					<q>Screen-reader accessible</q> search would be valued by screen reader users, and a way to ensure
				no publications with hazards are downloaded would be valued by those with light-sensitive epilepsy or
				other hazard-related conditions. But if only a single additional search filter fits best in a site's UI,
				a tool for finding accessible materials that declare conformance to WCAG 2.0 is the best choice to
				provide.</p>
