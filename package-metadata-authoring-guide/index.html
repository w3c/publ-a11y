			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="overview">
				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>Accessibility metadata expressed in the EPUB 3 <a data-cite="epub-3#sec-package-doc">package
						document</a> [[epub-3]] is derived from three main sources: <a href="https://schema.org"
						>Schema.org</a> [[schema-org]], the <a data-cite="epub-a11y#app-a11y-vocab">EPUB accessibility
						vocabulary</a> [[epub-a11y]] and its related properties, and <a
						href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a>
					[[dcterms]].</p>

				<p>Schema.org is described as a <q>collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain,
						and promote schemas for structured data.</q> Of particular importance is that it includes the
					following set of accessibility properties for describing creative works:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessMode">accessMode</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient">accessModeSufficient</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature">accessibilityFeature</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard">accessibilityHazard</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary">accessibilitySummary</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>These properties are key to the discoverability of EPUB publications and are central to the
					requirements of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y/">EPUB Accessibility standard</a>
					[[epub-a11y]]. They are also used to generate accessibility statements about a publication, as
					described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/metadata-display-guide/guidelines/"
						>Accessibility Metadata Display Guide for Digital Publications</a> [[a11y-display-guide]].</p>

				<p>To provide maximum value for readers, the metadata needs to be consistent, which is where the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/">Schema.org Accessibility Properties for
						Discoverability Vocabulary</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] comes in. This vocabulary defines
					controlled sets terms to use with each applicable property.</p>

				<p>But as schema.org is intended to describe any resource on or referenced from the web, the vocabulary
					definitions do not always fully reflect how to apply the terms to EPUB publications. That is where
					this guide fits in. Its goal is to add clarity on how to apply the metadata to both reflowable and
					fixed-layout EPUB publications.</p>

				<p>The accessibility properties defined in the EPUB accessibility vocabulary are identifiable by the use
					of the <code>a11y</code> prefix (e.g., <code>a11y:certifiedBy</code>). They do not have a single
					focus in the same way as the schema.org properties &#8212; new properties are typically only added
					if there are gaps in other metadata standards.</p>

				<p>One of their primary uses is to provide additional information about conformance claims. The Dublin
					Core <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#conformsTo"
							><code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property</a> [[dcterms]] is used to declare conformance to
					a standard such as the EPUB Accessibility [[epub-a11y]] specification, while the EPUB accessibility
					properties provide additional context, such as:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>who evaluated the publication (<a data-cite="epub-a11y#certifiedBy"
								><code>a11y:certifiedBy</code></a>);</li>
					<li>any credentials help by the evaluator (<a data-cite="epub-a11y#certifierCredential"
								><code>a11y:certifierCredential</code></a>);</li>
					<li>if a full evaluation report is available (<a data-cite="epub-a11y#certifierReport"
								><code>a11y:certifierReport</code></a>); and</li>
					<li>who to contact for more information about the accessibility of a publication (<a
							data-cite="epub-a11y#contactEmail"><code>a11y:contactEmail</code></a>).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The Dublin Core vocabulary also includes the <a
						href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#date"
							><code>dcterms:date</code> property</a> [[dcterms]] that is used to indicate when an
					evaluation was performed.</p>

				<p>The EPUB accessibility vocabulary additionally includes properties that are not yet, or may never be,
					officially added to the vocabulary in the EPUB Accessibility standard [[epub-a11y]]. The most
					notable of these properties is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-exemption/"
							><code>a11y:exemption</code></a> [[epub-a11y-exemption]], which is used to indicate that a
					publication fails accessibility conformance but is exempted from conformance under the laws of a
					jurisdiction.</p>

				<p>The combination of all this accessibility information in the <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]] provides users with a
					better picture of whether the content is going to meet their specific needs. The rest of this
					document delves into the specifics of when and how to apply this metadata.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Accessibility metadata can also be expressed in supply chains through the provision of ONIX
						records, but that is outside of the scope of this document. For more information, refer to the
							<a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/crosswalk/">Digital Publishing -
							Accessibility Metadata Crosswalk</a> as well as the ONIX <a

				<h3>Relationship to EPUB 2</h3>

				<p>Although the primary focus of this document is on EPUB 3 [[epub-3]], it is also expected that it can
					be used as a reference for adding accessibility metadata to EPUB 2 publications [[opf-201]].</p>

				<p>Not all of the accessibility features detailed in this document apply to EPUB 2, however; in large
					part because it is based on the older [[xhtml11]] standard so lacks the advanced markup features of
					EPUB 3. The <a href="#features-identifying">appendix on identifying features</a> indicates when a
					feature does not apply to EPUB 2.</p>

				<p>In addition, the syntax for adding metadata to the EPUB 2 package document is not the same as adding
					metadata to the EPUB 3 package document. The <code>meta</code> tag changed significantly between
					versions. In particular, the <code>name</code> attribute was changed to <code>property</code> and
					the <code>content</code> attribute was replaced with text between the <code>meta</code> opening and
					closing tags. Examples in the body of the document will have to be adapted to EPUB 2's syntax.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata differences">
					<p>EPUB 3 declaration of an <a href="#accessibilityFeature">accessibility feature</a>:</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">alternativeText&lt;/meta></pre>
					<p>Equivalent EPUB 2 declaration:</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta name="schema:accessibilityFeature" content="alternativeText"/></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>EPUB 2 also lacks the <a data-cite="epub-3#attrdef-refines"><code>refines</code> attribute</a>
					[[epub-3]] for connecting metadata properties. This primarily affects conformance metadata claims
					where certain assumptions will have to be made by any agent that processes the metadata. It is not
					possible, for example, to link a certifier to a credential they hold, but a processing agent could
					assume that a credential belongs to an evaluator if the metadata only declares one evaluator.</p>

				<p>One field where this will not work, however, is with the <a href="#report-date">evaluation date</a>.
					Without an explicit link to the conformance statement, the <code>dcterms:date</code> property will
					appear to be a generic date associated with the publication.</p>

			<h2>Access modes</h2>

			<section id="accessmode-setting">
				<h3>Setting access modes</h3>

				<p>An access mode is defined as a "human sense perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a
					user may process or perceive the content of a digital resource." [[iso24751-3]] For example, if an
						<a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] contains images and
					video, visual perception is required to consume the content exactly as it was created.</p>

				<p>There are four access modes that are typically specified for EPUB publications:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><a href="#accessmode-textual"><strong>textual</strong></a> — the publication contains text
							content (headings, paragraphs, etc.).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="#accessmode-visual"><strong>visual</strong></a> — the publication contains visual
							content such as images, graphics, diagrams, animations, and video.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="#accessmode-auditory"><strong>auditory</strong></a> — the publication contains
							auditory content such as standalone audio clips and audio soundtracks for video content.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><a href="#accessmode-tactile"><strong>tactile</strong></a> — the publication contains tactile
							content such as embedded braille and tactile diagrams.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>For users to determine whether an EPUB publication is suitable for their needs, they need to know
					which of these access modes are required to consume the content.</p>

				<p>To provide this information, the applicable access modes are specified using the <a
						href="https://schema.org/accessMode"><dfn id="schema:accessMode"
							><code>schema:accessMode</code></dfn> property</a> [[schema-org]], repeating the property
					for each applicable mode — the access modes must not be grouped together in a single tag.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for textual and visual access modes">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The order in which the access modes are declared currently does not carry any meaning, but a useful
					practice is to list the access modes by their relevance to reading the content. For example, if a
					book is primarily text but has some images, list <code>textual</code> first and <code>visual</code>
					second.</p>

				<p><strong>Do not</strong> list access modes for content that does not contain information necessary to
					understand a publication. Most EPUB publications contain cover images, for example, but it is not
					necessary to see the cover image to read the publication. The same is true of publisher logos and
					images in the content are only for presentational purposes (i.e., have no information so have empty
					[[html]] [^img/alt^] attribute values). If these are the only visual content, then it is not valid
					to list a visual access mode. Similarly, if the only audio an EPUB publication contains is
					background music (e.g., for an instructional video with text captions, or as mood music while
					reading), listing an auditory access mode is not valid.</p>

				<p>Note that the access modes of the content do not reflect any adaptations that have been provided. For
					example, if a comic book also includes alternative text for each image, it does not have a textual
					access mode. See the following section on <a href="#accessModeSufficient">sufficient access
						modes</a> for how to indicate that the available adaptations allow the content to be consumed in
					another mode.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For examples of how to express primary and sufficient access modes in real world situations,
						refer to <a href="#examples-am-ams-combination"></a>.</p>
				</div>

				<section id="accessmode-conformance">
					<h4>EPUB Accessibility conformance</h4>

					<p>[[[epub-a11y]]] [[epub-a11y]] only recommends that the access modes of a publication be specified
						in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature"
								><code>accessMode</code> property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]] as they are not as important
						for determining usability as the <a href="#accessModeSufficient">sufficient access
						modes</a>.</p>

					<p>Regardless, it is considered best practice to always specify the access modes to provide users
						with the most complete information about the content.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="accessmode-primary">
				<h4>Primary access modes</h4>

				<div class="feature-list">
					<p class="feature-hd">In this section:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#auditory">auditory</a></li>
						<li><a href="#tactile">tactile</a></li>
						<li><a href="#textual">textual</a></li>
						<li><a href="#visual">visual</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>The primary access modes are the ones that directly capture how the information necessary to read and
					understand a publication is encoded. They do not include affordances to make content accessible,
					such as alternative text and extended descriptions to make visual content readable. The following
					sections explain when to apply each of the primary access modes.</p>

				<section id="accessmode-textual">
					<h5>Text content</h5>

					<p>The most common access mode for <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a>
						[[epub-3]] is textual. It indicates that at least some of the information necessary to read a
						publication is encoded using Unicode characters [[unicode]], and is declared by setting a <dfn
							id="textual">textual <span hidden="hidden">(access mode)</span></dfn> access mode in the <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for a textual access mode">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessMode">textual&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Not all the text content in a publication is necessary to read it, so when declaring a
							<code>textual</code> access mode ensure that the text data conveys information necessary to
						read the authored content. Some instances that would not count toward a <code>textual</code>
						access mode include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>when only the table of contents in the <a data-cite="epub-3#sec-nav">EPUB navigation
								document</a> [[epub-3]] contains text;</li>
						<li>when the text is extraneous information added by the publisher, such as a list of other
							works by the author or a biography of the author;</li>
						<li>cataloging, copyright, and other publisher information found on the title page verso;</li>
						<li>an audio book that includes only the major section headings for synchronization using <a
								data-cite="epub-3#sec-media-overlays">media overlays</a> [[epub-3]].</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Excluding this kind of text content avoids giving a misleading picture of the publication. A
						comic, for example, might only have a page of text content that displays the publisher's info
						while the body is composed entirely of images. The text content in this case will not be useful
						to anyone wanting to read the story.</p>

					<p>As access modes do not take into account any affordances used to make non-textual content
						accessible (such as alternative text and descriptions for images or transcripts for audio), do
						not declare a textual access mode if these are the only text content (e.g., for a manga or
						comics).</p>

					<p>A textual access mode is also not declared if the only text content is encoded as images. For
						example, headings represented as images in order to preserve unique styling and images of text
						in the panels of comics are not considered in determining if there is a textual access mode.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>If the text data is preserved separately from the image data &#8212; for example, by using
							the [[svg2]] <a data-cite="svg2/struct.html#TitleElement"><code>title</code></a> or <a
								data-cite="svg2/struct.html#DescElement"><code>desc</code></a> elements &#8212; then a
							textual access mode would be declared as such data is accessible to assistive technologies
							and can sometimes have its appearance modified by <a
								data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]].</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="accessmode-visual">
					<h5>Visual content</h5>

					<p>It is common for <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> [[epub-3]] to
						contain some visual content, and even be entirely image based as in the case of comics and
						manga. Visual does not mean the information is only in static images, either. Visual content
						also encompasses videos as well any dynamic content, such as interactive images or games drawn
						on the [[html]] [^canvas^] element.</p>

					<p>When at least some of the information necessary to read a publication is encoded in visual form,
						a <dfn id="visual">visual <span hidden="hidden">(access mode)</span></dfn> access mode is
						declared in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for a visual access mode">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessMode">visual&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Not all visual content in a publication carries information necessary to its understanding.
						Examples of when a <code>visual</code> access mode would not be set include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>for the cover page;</li>
						<li>for visual content that is purely presentational (e.g., decorative images and games only
							meant to engage students without adding any new information);</li>
						<li>for visual content that is extraneous information added by the publisher (e.g., corporate
							logos, author headshot, etc.)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Not setting a <code>visual</code> access mode for these kinds of cases avoids users mistakenly
						believing that they have to be able to see the authored content in order to read and understand
						it.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="accessmode-auditory">
					<h5>Auditory content</h5>

					<p>Auditory content includes any content that requires a user to be able to hear it in order to
						understand it. The most common forms of auditory content are standalone audio clips embedded in
						a publication and any video that is accompanied by an auditory track, but sounds can be
						important in other ways, too. If an interactive graphic drawn on the [[html]] [^canvas^] element
						includes auditory cues or announcements, for example, or if auditory cues are the only
						indication to users that time is running out on an interaction, auditory perception is
						required.</p>

					<p>When at least some of the information necessary to read a publication is encoded in auditory
						form, an <dfn id="auditory">auditory <span hidden="hidden">(access mode)</span></dfn> access
						mode is declared in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
						[[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for an auditory access mode">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessMode">auditory&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Not all auditory content in a publication carries information necessary to its understanding.
						Examples of when an <code>auditory</code> access mode would not be set include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>for mood music that plays in the background while reading;</li>
						<li>for background music in an instructional video when all the information is conveyed
							visually;</li>
						<li>for the background sound to an interactive game when it is solely for entertainment
							value;</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Not setting an <code>auditory</code> access mode for these kinds of cases avoids users mistakenly
						believing that they have to be able to hear the authored content in order to read and understand
						it.</p>

					<section id="accessMode-sync">
						<h6>Synchronized text and audio</h6>

						<p>A special case for audio in EPUB 3 involves text and audio synchronization using the <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-media-overlays">media overlays feature</a>
							[[epub-3]]. Setting the correct access modes and sufficient access modes for EPUB 3
							publications that contain synchronized text-audio playback requires evaluating whether
							playback is essential to reading the publication or whether it is included as an optional
							feature.</p>

						<p>One of the more common features of media overlays, particularly in mainstream publishing, is
							to provide synchronized playback of the full text of a publication with full audio
							narration. These types of publications are commonly referred to as "read aloud" books, as
							the user chooses whether or not to turn on the narration (unlike traditional audiobooks
							where only the audio is available).</p>

						<p>In this case, because the audio playback is an extra feature, and is not required for reading
							the publication, it is <strong>not</strong> listed as an auditory access mode. Instead, the
							presence of text and audio synchronization is declared using the <a
								href="#synchronizedAudioText"><code>synchronizedAudioText</code> accessibility

						<p>Having full audio playback capability in this case means that an <a href="#ams-auditory"
								>auditory sufficient access mode</a> needs to be declared — the user can listen to the
							complete publication as an alternative to reading the text.</p>

						<aside class="example"
							title="Package document markup for a book with full text and audio synchronization">

						<div class="note">
							<p>When media overlays are present, the "<code>auditory</code>" value should not be added to
								all the possible sufficient access modes just because it is possible to turn on

							<p>For example, a publication with media overlays that has text and images (with text

						<p>Another use for media overlays — more typical among accessible republishers such as libraries

							does not allow meaningful visual reading or text-to-speech playback; it is only to provide
							structured navigation capabilities.</p>

						<p>In this case, being able to hear the audio is essential to being able to read the

						<p>In a reverse of the first case discussed, text-audio synchronization is <strong>not</strong>
							identified as a feature of the publication since the amount of text provided is trivial.</p>

						<p>Likewise, since the text in the publication only provides heading navigation, a

					<h5>Tactile content</h5>

					<p>Tactile content is less common in mainstream <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
							publications</a> [[epub-3]] but it is sometimes found in content produced specially for
						users who are blind, and in particular is central to the <a href="https://daisy.org/s/ebraille/"
							>eBraille format</a> which is based on EPUB 3.</p>

					<p>The <code>tactile</code> access mode partly overlaps with both <a href="#accessmode-textual"
								><code>textual</code></a> and <a href="#accessmode-visual"><code>visual</code></a> in
						what it represents, but the difference is in how. Using braille Unicode characters (see <a
							href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_2800.html">Braille Patterns</a>
						[[unicode]]) to represent the text content is a direct corollary to a textual access mode, while
						tactile graphics and objects are how visual imagery get represented.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>A tactile access mode is never declared simply because it is possible to convert standard
							text content into braille on the fly. Users seeking to find content that can be converted in
							this way will look for a fully textual <a href="#accessModeSufficient">sufficient access
								mode</a>.</p>
					</div>

					<p>When at least some of the information necessary to read a publication is encoded in tactile form,
						a <dfn id="tactile">tactile <span hidden="hidden">(access mode)</span></dfn> access mode is
						declared in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for a tactile access mode">

					<p>The same as with the textual and visual content it represents, not all tactile content in a

						mainstream publication could, for example, include links to embossable tactile graphics or

				<p>The visual content indicators are a special class of values that extend the <a
						href="#accessmode-visual">visual access mode</a>. They provide additional information about the
					type of content that is encoded visually.</p>

				<p>The most common method of encoding visual content in EPUB is as images. Although support for MathML
					[[mathml3]] has improved in recent years, it is still common, for example, to find math equations in
						<a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> [[epub-3]] represented as
					images to ensure their rendering. Informing users who are blind that a publication has <a
						href="#mathOnVisual">images of math</a> lets them know that they will have to rely on
					alternative text and extended descriptions instead of being able to inspect the equations in the
					kind of detail that MathML allows. It is also an aid to visual readers, as it indicates that the
					text cannot be resized (only zoomed) or have its appearance changed as necessary to make it more
					accessible.</p>

				<p>But the visual content indicators are not exclusive to image formats. If a video has information that
					requires color perception to understand, for example, a <a href="#colorDependent">color dependence
						indicator</a> could be set. Or, if an interactive chart is drawn on an [[html]] [^canvas^]
					element, the <a href="#chartOnVisual">chart on visual</a> could be set.</p>

				<p>More than one visual content indicator can apply to a piece of visual content. A publication with an
					image of a chart that uses color to represent the data, for example, would include both the <a
						href="#chartOnVisual">chart on visual</a> and <a href="colorDependent">color dependence</a>
					indicators. When declaring visual content indicators, make sure to check a publication's visual
					content for all that apply.</p>

				<p>As the visual content indicators are a supplementary piece of information, their use is only
					advisory. It is more important to ensure that a <code>visual</code> access mode is set. Moreover,
					the declaration of a visual content indicator must never occur without the declaration a
						<code>visual</code> access mode.</p>

						<p>If the chemical content is decorative, then this value is not declared. For example, a

						<p>MathML and LaTeX are sometimes used to represent chemical content in a publication. In these

						<p>An example of color dependence would be a bar chart where each bar is a different color and a

						<p>This value does not apply if there are secondary indicators that allow users to distinguish

						<p>There are many reasons why images of text are included in EPUB publications. Appearance is
							one, as having to faithfully represent the appearance of the text in a print edition because
							font and CSS support cannot reliably replicate an effect is sometimes non-negotiable for a
							publisher. Or an original document, like a newspaper clipping or historical document, is
							reproduced exactly as it was printed. It also includes the text encoded in the images of
							comics and manga, children's books, cookbooks, and other image-based fixed layout
							publications.</p>
						<p>As with the other visual indicators, the representation of text in visual form also
							encompasses video content. A silent instructional video, for example, might include text
							directives directly in the video.</p>
						<p>In all these cases, it would be appropriate to list <code>textOnVisual</code> as an access
							mode. Only if the text in the visual content is in a decorative image or not directly
							relevant to understanding the text is there no need to specify the <code>textOnVisual</code>
							indicator.</p>
						<p>For example, the text on signs and billboards in the background of a photograph do not
							represent text on visual imagery if they are incidental to what the image is conveying.
							Similarly, a publisher's name in their logo should not be declared as text on visual
							content.</p>
						<div class="note">
							<p>The use of SVG is a special case when semantic elements are used to add the text to the
								image. When this is done in reflowable EPUBs, the text on visual indicator can be
								omitted as there is the possibility to access and change the appearance of the text. But
								it would not be true in a fixed layout EPUB as <a
									data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] restrict
								control over the appearance of the pages.</p>
							<p>If SVG's text elements are not used to display the text, then <code>textOnVisual</code>
								is specified since the text is not separate from the drawn image.</p>

			<section id="ams-setting">
				<h3>Setting sufficient access modes</h3>

				<p>The access modes sufficient to consume an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
						publication</a> [[epub-3]] express a broader picture of the potential usability than do the <a
						href="#accessMode">primary access modes</a>. The primary access modes identify the default
					nature of the media used in the publication (e.g., that it has text and images). Sufficient access
					modes, on the other hand, account for all the ways that a user can read that content.</p>

				<p>Another way of thinking of the difference between the primary access modes and the sufficient access
					modes is that the sufficient access modes also account for the affordances and adaptations that have
					been provided. They allow users to determine whether the content can be read in a manner that is
					more useful to them. For example, a user with a screen reader will want to know if a book that
					consists of text and images can also be read entirely as text without loss of information — that
					there is alternative text and extended descriptions for the visual content.</p>

				<p>Sufficient access modes are identified in the <a href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"><dfn
							id="schema:accessModeSufficient"><code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code></dfn> property</a>
					[[schema-org]].</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata entries for a fully textual sufficient access mode">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Unlike the other Schema.org metadata expressed in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document"
						>package document</a> [[epub-3]], sufficient access modes can consist of one or more values
					separated by a comma and optional space. Because sufficient access modes are telling users the
					different ways that the content can be read, each set is expressed in a separate tag rather than
					each individual value.</p>

				<p>The most common reason for having multiple <code>schema:accessModeSufficient</code> declarations is
					to capture both the default nature of a publication as well as the alternative reading pathways
					available. For example, that a book with textual and visual content is also fully readable as
					text.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Metadata entries for a publication with multiple ways of fully reading the content">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Note that sufficiency of access is often a subjective determination based on an understanding of what
					information is essential to comprehending the text. Some information loss occurs by not being able
					to view a video, for example, but the visual or auditory losses might be considered inconsequential
					if a transcript provides all the necessary information to understand the concepts being
					conveyed.</p>

			<section id="ams-single-values">
				<h3>Single reading modes</h3>

				<p>Although sufficient access mode are expressed as sets consisting of one or more values, the most
					strongly recommended sets to list are the ones that consist of only a single value. The reason why
					these are the most important is that they tell users that all the content can be read in the
					specified method.</p>

				<p>Someone who is blind, for example, might want to know that all the content is available in text form
					so they can use an assistive technology or their <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system"
						>reading system's</a> [[epub-3]] built-in read aloud functionality to read the book. Or they
					might want to know that all the content is available as pre-recorded audio for enhanced legibility.
					They are going to be less interested that if you can perceive text, visual, and auditory content
					that you can also read the book (even though this is the default sufficient access mode based on the
					primary access modes), as the visual content is problematic without the provision of alternative
					text and long descriptions.</p>

				<p>The possible single sufficient access mode values are identical to the <a href="#accessMode">primary
						access modes</a>, as described in the following sections.</p>

				<section id="ams-single-textual">
					<h4>Textual</h4>

					<p>Setting the <dfn id="ams-textual">textual <span hidden="hidden">(sufficient access
							mode)</span></dfn> value indicates that information necessary to read a publication is
						available in text form.</p>

					<p>Unlike a <a href="#accessmode-textual">textual primary access mode</a>, the inclusion of text
						alternatives such as alternative text, extended descriptions, closed captions, and transcripts
						does allow a textual sufficient access mode to be set.</p>

					<p>When <code>textual</code> is the only sufficient access mode set, it means that all the
						information necessary to read the publication is available in textual form, so it is generally
						interpreted as indicating that the publication is screen-reader and dynamic braille display
						friendly.</p>

					<p>A single textual sufficient access mode can be set for <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication"
							>EPUB publications</a> [[epub-3]] that conform to <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/#cc1_A">Level A</a> [[wcag2]] or higher, for example, as
						there must be textual alternatives for non-text content to meet these thresholds.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="ams-single-visual">
					<h4>Visual</h4>

					<p>Setting the <dfn id="ams-visual">visual <span hidden="hidden">(sufficient access
							mode)</span></dfn> value indicates that information necessary to read a publication is
						available in visual form, such as images and video.</p>

					<p>When <code>visual</code> is the only sufficient access mode set, it means that all the
						information necessary to read the publication is available in visual form. It is most often
						applied to works like comics and manga.</p>

					<p>A single visual sufficient access mode is typically the least accessible single sufficient access
						mode that can be set, as it indicates that only sighted readers can access the information of
						the publication. It does not, by itself, mean the publication is not accessible, but there would
						need to be another single sufficient access mode declaration to indicate the publication is
						readable by non-visual users.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="ams-single-auditory">
					<h4>Auditory</h4>

					<p>Setting the <dfn id="ams-auditory">auditory <span hidden="hidden">(sufficient access

						available as prerecorded audio (whether prerecorded human speech or prerecorded synthetic
						speech).</p>

					<p>When <code>auditory</code> is the only sufficient access mode set, it means that all the
						information necessary to read the publication is available as prerecorded audio.</p>

					<p>A single auditory sufficient access mode typically indicates that media overlays have been used
						to provide audio for all the text and visual content, but it could also set if, for example, a
						book of poetry also contained (non-synchronized) recordings for each poem.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>An <code>auditory</code> sufficient access mode is not set for textual content that the user
							might be able to get rendered as synthetic speech via their <a

				</section>

				<section id="ams-single-tactile">
					<h4>Tactile</h4>

					<p>Setting the <dfn id="ams-tactile">tactile <span hidden="hidden">(sufficient access

						graphics, and tactile objects are included in the publication.</p>

					<p>Unlike a <a href="#accessmode-tactile">tactile primary access mode</a>, providing links to
						tactile graphics and objects does allow a tactile sufficient access mode to be set. Such linked
						content, however, rarely correlates with a publication being fully readable in tactile form; see

					<p>When <code>tactile</code> is the only sufficient access mode set, it means that all the

					<p>A single tactile sufficient access mode is the least common single sufficient access mode, at
						least for mainstream publishing. It is typically associated with a braille publication produced
						in the EPUB format.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="ams-combined-values">
				<h3>Combined reading modes</h3>

				<p>Although the <a href="#ams-single-values">single sufficient access modes</a> are considered the most
					important to set, it is also helpful to give users a complete picture of all the ways the content
					can be read, especially if the primary access modes are not set.</p>

				<p>Publications that have more than one primary access mode always have a sufficient access mode set
					that is the combination of all those primary modes. For example, a book with text and images has <a
						href="#textual"><code>textual</code></a> and <a href="#visual"><code>visual</code></a> primary
					access modes. Since those two values tell the user that they have to be able to read text content
					and perceive visual content, the content has a sufficient reading mode that combines the
						<code>textual</code> and <code>visual</code> values.</p>

				<aside class="example"
					title="Metadata showing primary access modes combined into a default sufficient access mode">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   textual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   textual,visual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Because sufficient access modes account for affordances, the possible sets of sufficient access modes
					are not always strictly combinations of the primary modes, even if there is always one set that
					equals all the primary modes. An example would be a comic that only provides alternative text so is
					not fully accessible as text. In this case, it would have a <code>visual</code> primary access mode
					but also a sufficient access mode set that includes <code>visual</code> and
					<code>textual</code>.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Sufficient access modes for a visual work with alternative text">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessMode">
   visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   visual
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessModeSufficient">
   visual,textual
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The combinations of possible sufficient access modes grows as there are more primary access modes and
					affordances to make them accessible. This is why it is not always helpful to users to have all the
					possibilities listed. It can make the metadata more confusing to understand.</p>

				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<section id="features-setting">
					<h4>Setting features</h4>

					<p>Identifying the accessibility features and adaptations included in an <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] allows users to
						determine whether the content is usable at a more fine-grained level than the access modes
						do.</p>

					<p>For example, a math textbook might have a textual access mode, but that alone does not indicate
						whether MathML markup is available. Whether a visual work only provides alternative text or
						whether it includes extended descriptions is also important to know when gauging its
						usability.</p>

					<p>Accessibility features are identified in the <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature"
								><dfn id="schema:accessibilityFeature"
							><code>schema:accessibilityFeature</code></dfn> property</a> [[schema-org]]. The property is
						repeated for each feature &#8212; do not group all the features into one tag.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Metadata for MathML and alternative text">
						<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   MathML
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityFeature">
   alternativeText
&lt;/meta></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The EPUB format requires that some accessibility features will always be present (e.g., a table
						of contents). Do not exclude these features from the accessibility metadata, as users typically
						are not aware what features are built into a format. Failing to include entries will reduce the
						discoverability of the publication when users search for specific features.</p>

					<section id="features-conformance">
						<h5>EPUB Accessibility conformance</h5>

						<p>[[[epub-a11y]]] [[epub-a11y]] requires that the accessibility features of an <a
								data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] be specified in
							the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature"
									><code>accessibilityFeature</code> property</a> [[a11y-discov-vocab]]. This means
							that at least one accessibility feature must be declared in the <a
								data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata in
							order for an EPUB publication to claim conformance.</p>

						<div class="note">
							<p>Although the vocabulary for the <code>accessibilityFeature</code> property contains the
								values "<a href="#features-none"><code>none</code></a>" and "<a href="#features-unknown"
										><code>unknown</code></a>", these terms cannot be used to meet the reporting
								requirements for the property. At least one feature that is not one of these values is
								required to claim conformance to EPUB Accessibility 1.2.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section id="features-claims">
					<h4>When to claim features</h4>

					<p>One of the most common questions about accessibility features is not what they refer to but when
						they can be claimed in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
						[[epub-3]] metadata. Features may not be applicable in every situation, for example, such as is
						the case for extended descriptions. Or a mix of features might be used, such as to provide
						alternatives for audio and video content.</p>

					<p>Ideally, a feature will only be claimed when it covers all applicable cases, as this will make
						the content optimally accessible. But limiting reporting to this standard would mean that users
						will have difficulty determining if content that may not be fully conforming to accessibility
						standards may still be usable to them.</p>

					<p>Consequently, a measure of common sense is necessary when deciding whether to declare a feature
						that is not applied universally. The goal of this metadata is to help users determine the
						suitability of the content, not to make publishers feel better about content that they know they
						have not made fully accessible.</p>

					<p>If only one out of a hundred images that needs extended descriptions has one, for example,
						claiming that the publication provides this feature is clearly stretching the truth. But if half
						the images are described, there is some value to users.</p>

					<p>The key when not providing full coverage is to detail why not in the <a
							href="#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a> so that users are aware of the
						limitations up front. The following information is especially useful to provide when making
						claims against incomplete coverage:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>why there are coverage gaps and if an update is planned to fix them;</li>
						<li>a rough estimate of how complete the coverage is; and</li>
						<li>if possible, which sections or chapters have complete coverage and which do not.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section id="features-unknown">
					<h4>When features are not known</h4>

					<p>There may be times when the presence of accessibility features is not known but a statement is
						still needed in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]]
						metadata. This usually happens if a placeholder is needed until an accessibility evaluation is
						carried out.</p>

					<p>To indicate that the presence of accessibility features is not known, the <dfn id="unknown"
							>unknown <span hidden="hidden">(feature)</span></dfn> accessibility feature is declared.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for unknown features">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">unknown&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The <code>unknown</code> value is not intended for permanent use in an EPUB. If a publication is
						distributed with the value because the publisher cannot wait on an accessibility review to
						complete, it is expected that they will release an updated publication with new metadata once
						the evaluation is complete.</p>

					<p>The <code>unknown</code> value <strong>must not</strong> be set if any other
							<code>accessibilityFeature</code> value is also declared. Declaring <code>unknown</code>
						acts as a temporary placeholder, explicitly stating that an accessibility audit has not yet been
						performed. It distinguishes the content from a publication that has been audited and confirmed
						to have <a href="#features-none">no features</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="features-none">
					<h4>When there are no features</h4>

					<p>It is first worth noting that it is rare that there are no accessibility features in an <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]], even if the
						publication as a whole does not meet minimum accessibility conformance standards. Except for
						some edge cases, all EPUBs can typically claim to provide a <a href="#tableOfContents">table of
							contents</a>, for example, since this is a required component of the standard. It is also
						most often the case that reflowable EPUB publications can claim a <a href="#readingOrder"
							>reading order</a>.</p>

					<p>But in the case where an EPUB publication provides no accessibility features, the lack of
						features is indicated in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
						[[epub-3]] metadata using the <dfn id="none">none <span hidden="hidden">(feature)</span></dfn>
						value.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for no accessibility features">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">none&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>This value <strong>must not</strong> be set if any other <code>accessibilityFeature</code> value
						is declared. Declaring the <code>none</code> value provides an explicit and unambiguous
						statement that no specific accessibility features have been included, which aids in content
						discovery. This is different from a publication that simply omits all accessibility
						metadata.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="features-organization">
					<h4>Organization of this section</h4>

					<p>This section addresses accessibility features based on common use patterns rather than as
						individual values in isolation.</p>

					<p>All the features that are used to address the accessibility of audio and video are discussed

					<p>A navigation menu is included at the start of each section to help locate which features are

			<section id="aural-rendering">
				<h3>Aural rendering</h3>

				<div class="feature-list">
					<p class="feature-hd">In this section:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#synchronizedAudioText">synchronizedAudioText</a></li>
						<li><a href="#ttsMarkup">ttsMarkup</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>EPUB 3 publications allow the aural rendering of text content through the use of text-to-speech (TTS)
					playback (commonly referred to as "read aloud" capability) and <a
						data-cite="epub-3#sec-media-overlays">media overlays</a> [[epub-3]]. Both renderings are capable
					of providing audio playback of the text synchronized with highlighting of the associated text.</p>

				<p>Text-to-speech engines, however, often fail to provide accurate readings of the text. Heteronyms, for
					example, where two words are spelled the same but have different pronunciations, often result in the
					wrong word being pronounced. Complex words, such as chemical names and technical jargon, also result
					in illegible playback, as do fictional words and names created by an author (for example, in works
					of science fiction). TTS playback also suffers from an inability to indicate emphasis or to control
					the pacing and prosody of the narration.</p>

				<p>It is possible to provide enhancements in the markup of <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication"
						>EPUB publications</a> [[epub-3]] to help TTS engines render text accurately. EPUB 3's <a
						data-cite="epub-tts#ssml">SSML attributes</a> [[epub-tts]], for example, were intended to allow
					the inlining of pronunciation information, while PLS lexicons [[pronunciation-lexicon]] were
					designed to provide a reusable library of pronunciations. CSS Speech [[css-speech]] properties
					address the issues text-to-speech playback quality (for example, the voice to use, whether to spell
					out words, and when to provide emphasis).</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, at this time none of these technologies have been proven to work at any kind of scale
					in EPUB <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]]. Despite this
					shortcoming, if a publisher makes the effort to enhance TTS playback for a specific regional use
					case, they can indicate this by adding the <dfn id="ttsMarkup">ttsMarkup</dfn> feature to the <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the text-to-speech feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">ttsMarkup&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>It is only recommended to set this feature if the TTS enhancements substantively cover the rendering
					issues that are likely to arise — recognizing that different TTS engines have different capabilities
					and authors cannot anticipate every misreading they might make.</p>

				<p>Media overlays differ from text-to-speech playback in that they provide prerecorded audio
					synchronized with the text. The synchronization, and granularity of playback synchronization, is set
					by the creator of the EPUB publication through markup files that conform to a profile of the SMIL
					[[smil]] standard.</p>

				<p>When including media overlays, the <dfn id="synchronizedAudioText">synchronizedAudioText</dfn>
					feature is specified in the package document.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the synchronized audio and text feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">synchronizedAudioText&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The audio provided with media overlays is typically human narrated but some producers will also use
					text-to-speech engines to create the audio. Prerecorded text-to-speech narration is often used when
					providing audio-synchronized playback of backmatter, which is tedious for humans to read.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Media overlays also makes it possible to synchronize dynamic text-to-speech rendering with text
						highlighting, although this is not commonly done or supported by reading systems.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The use of the TTS enhancements and media overlays is not mutually exclusive. TTS markup enhancements
					could be provided, for example, to improve the quality of the media overlays dynamic TTS generation
					feature. Some non-visual readers also prefer to use a reading system's read aloud capabilities even
					when media overlays are available as it allows them to read faster.</p>

			<section id="chemistry">
				<h3>Chemistry</h3>

				<div class="feature-list">
					<p class="feature-hd">In this section:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#latex-chemistry">latex-chemistry</a></li>
						<li><a href="#MathML-chemistry">MathML-chemistry</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>Providing accessible markup for chemical formulas and equations allows users to inspect the equations
					themselves rather than rely on images of the content with alternative text and descriptions. Even
					when care is taken in the writing of descriptions, ambiguities can arise because human language is
					not always as precise as the equations themselves.</p>

				<p>Accessible markup also provides a robust, accessible alternative to images, as the notation can be
					resized, searched, copied, and interpreted correctly by screen readers.</p>

				<p>Although EPUB 3, and web browsers more broadly, do not currently support <a href="#ChemML"
					>ChemML</a>, there are still two markup syntaxes that can be used to add accessible chemical
					formulas and equations.</p>

				<p>The first of these, despite its name, is MathML [[mathml3]]. MathML provides a structured, semantic
					representation that can be rendered directly by modern browsers and assistive technologies. MathML
					markup is added directly to <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content
						document</a> [[epub-3]]. Just as it is able to represent mathematical equations, its syntax is
					also adaptable to representing chemical equations and formulas.</p>

				<p>When an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] contains chemical
					formulas and equations marked up as MathML, the <dfn id="MathML-chemistry">MathML-chemistry</dfn>
					feature is set in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a>
					[[epub-3]].</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the MathML chemistry feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">MathML-chemistry&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>It is not required that every chemical equation or formula be represented as MathML in order to set
					this value, but the coverage should be substantive. Judgement will always be involved in determining
					whether MathML is necessary for every equation. Some simple equations may not benefit from the
					additional markup overhead.</p>

				<p>The other way to represent chemical equations and formulas is using the LaTeX typesetting system.
					LaTeX rendering is not natively supported in <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading
						systems</a> [[epub-3]], so it is often only used by publishers for preparing print manuscripts
					and transformed into another form, like images, for digital publications. But it is possible to
					embed LaTeX-formatted equations and use a JavaScript library like MathJAX to translate them for
					visual reading (the caveat, of course, is that not all reading systems support scripting).</p>

				<p>Another possible use for LaTeX-formatted equations is as the alternative text for images, although
					this can lead to poor pronunciation by assistive technologies.</p>

				<p>One reason for including the raw LaTeX is that it offers users the opportunity to copy the equations
					and use them in an application that allows them to read the syntax. But whether users are able to do
					this depends on whether they know how to unzip an EPUB and locate the equations, and whether digital
					rights management schemes even allow them access into the EPUB.</p>

				<p>For these reasons, it is not common to find LaTeX-formatted chemical equations and formulas in EPUBs,
					but if the syntax is provided the <dfn id="latex-chemistry">latex-chemistry</dfn> feature is set in
					the package document.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the LaTeX chemistry feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">latext-chemistry&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Similar to setting <code>MathML-chemistry</code>, it is not required that every chemical equation or
					formula be represented as LaTeX in order to set this value, but the coverage should be substantive
					for all complex equations.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Although in theory it is possible for an EPUB publication to contain chemical equations and
						formulas encoded both in MathML [[mathml3]] and LaTeX, such dual encoding is not found in
						practice. Publishers use one or the other syntax.</p>

						<li><a href="#displayTransformability">displayTransformability</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>The <dfn id="displayTransformability">displayTransformability</dfn> accessibility feature value is
					used to indicate that the user can modify the presentation of the text content of an <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] to their own preferences
					without negatively affecting the readability.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the display transformability feature">

      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>When to set the <code>displayTransformability</code> value depends on the characteristics of the
					language a publication is written in. In general, the following characteristics serve as a basis for
					what must be modifiable:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the text foreground and background colors</li>
					<li>the font family and size</li>
					<li>the paragraph spacing</li>
					<li>the line height</li>
					<li>the letter and word spacing</li>
					<li>the text alignment</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Making sure content is transformable on these characteristics will be sufficient for many languages.
					But not all of these characteristics will apply to all languages. And depending on the language,
					other requirements can be equally important to ensure are modifiable, such as:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the writing direction (horizontal or vertical)</li>
					<li>the display of ruby (both visibility and text color)</li>
					<li>the inclusion of space characters as word separators</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Providing guidelines tailored to every language is outside the scope of this guide so publishers
						will need to take into consideration local accessibility needs when determining if the content
						is sufficiently transformable. One measure of conformance is to match the transformability to
						common display control properties provided by <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system"
							>reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] tailored to the local language.</p>
				</div>

				<p>To claim this feature, text must not be represented as images unless it falls under one of the
					exceptions specified in <a data-cite="wcag2#images-of-text">success criterion 1.4.5</a> [[wcag2]] or
					the text is incidental to the purpose of the image (e.g., text on a billboard or street sign in the
					background of an image).</p>

				<p>In general, reflowable EPUB publications will meet display transformability requirements so long as
					none of the content is constrained visually by its bounding box. This typically only happens if
					overflow is clipped using CSS to prevent scroll bars from appearing. An example would be if a
					publisher adds a sidebar with a fixed height and width and clips any content that exceeds these
					dimensions. If the text is sized to neatly fit in this box only at the publisher's preferred
					display, increasing the font size or spacing would cause text to progressively disappear.</p>

				<p>This feature is not applicable to fixed layout EPUBs because reading systems do not allow users to
					modify the display. Reading systems must support the accessibility of a feature before it can be
					claimed.</p>

			<section id="enhanced-display">
				<h3>Enhanced display</h3>

				</div>

				<p>There are two values for indicating that the display of an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication"
						>EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] has been enhanced by the publisher.</p>

				<p>The first of these is the <dfn id="highContrastDisplay">highContrastDisplay</dfn> feature, which is
					used to state that there is a higher-than-normal contrast between text and its background.
					legibility for users with low vision or color vision deficiencies who require a to read
					comfortably.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the high contrast display feature">

				</aside>

				<p>This feature can be set when text and background color combinations meet or exceed the 7:1 contrast
					ratio for normal-sized text. It is the equivalent of meeting [[wcag2]] <a
						data-cite="wcag2#contrast-enhanced">success criterion 1.4.6</a>.</p>

				<p>Note that to meet the requirements for setting this feature that images of text also have to meet the

					typical exception for digital publications being for publisher and imprint logos.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The schema.org vocabulary does not define feature for meeting the minimal contrast requirements
						defined in [[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#contrast-minimum">success criteria 1.4.3</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The other feature for enhanced display is <dfn id="largePrint">largePrint</dfn> which is used to
					indicate that a publication has been formatted for users who require larger font sizes to read.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the large print feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">

      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">largePrint&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>There is no single accepted definition of what constitutes large print, so publishers should consult
					regional guidelines, when available, for what is acceptable. In general, though, a font size of 14pt
					to 16pt is considered enlarged print, while a font size of 18pt and above is considered large print.
					For this reason, it is recommended to include information about the large print formatting used in
					the accessibility summary so that users are not left guessing which size has been used.</p>

				<p>In practice, large print is rarely used in EPUB publications. Reflowable EPUBs can typically have
					their font size, family, line spacing, and other properties adjusted to whatever the user prefers
					(see the <a href="#displayTransformability">displayTransformability</a> feature). This is a much
					better feature for users than picking the specific formatting.</p>

				<p>It is also problematic to indicate that reflowable EPUB publications are formatted for large print
					reading when user preference settings are typically applied to the text. The formatting the
					publisher has provided may not be viewable unless the user reverts their own preferences.</p>

				<p>The <code>largePrint</code> feature must never be used to indicate that it is possible to reformat
					the text to a larger size (i.e., that the display is transformable). Features are set based on the
					defaults of a publication not on what it might be possible to achieve.</p>

				<p>The most likely scenario for setting the <code>largePrint</code> feature is when a print-equivalent
					reproduction of a physical large print book is created using EPUB 3 fixed layouts. But the reality
					is that such works are rarely, if ever, created.</p>

				<p>There are two primary features that identify that accessible alternatives have been provided:
					alternative text and extended descriptions. Alternative text is a short description that can stand
					in for the image (usually added to the [[html]] [^img/alt^] attribute in <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content documents</a> [[epub-3]]) while
					extended descriptions provide additional detail when images express information that cannot be
					conveyed through a brief description.</p>

				<p>With the exception of decorative images &#8212; those that convey no information needed to understand
					the text &#8212; all images require alternative text to be accessible. The accessibility feature for
					indicating that alternative text has been provided is <dfn id="alternativeText"
						>alternativeText</dfn>.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the alternative text feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">alternativeText&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The alternative text provided for images must be meaningful both to meet accessibility requirements
					and to claim the <code>alternativeText</code> accessibility feature. A publication that simply
					auto-fills every [[html]] [^img/alt^] attribute with the text "Image", for example, is not providing
					users with a meaningful alternative.</p>

				<p>Sometimes images will contain more information than can be expressed in a short alternative text
					field. In these cases, it is also necessary to provide an extended description. The accessibility
					feature for indicating that alternative text has been provided is <dfn id="longDescription"
						>longDescription</dfn>.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the long description feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">longDescription&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Similar to the requirement for claiming that alternative text has been provided, the extended
					descriptions for images must fully capture all information being conveyed through the image. It is
					not required that every image have a description, though, only those that require more extensive
					detail.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The name "long description" was commonly used in the past for extended descriptions and was the
						nomenclature behind the now obsolete <code>longdesc</code> attribute in HTML. The name was a
						misnomer, however, as the descriptions provide additional detail and complement alternative
						text, they are not simply longer in length. That is why "extended description" is now the common
						name. Changing the schema.org vocabulary would only add development costs, so the old name is
						still used in it.</p>

				<h3>Math</h3>

					<p class="feature-hd">In this section:</p>

				</div>

				<p>There are several ways to provide accessible math equations in <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> but support in <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] has historically been
					a barrier to the adoption of the most accessible methods. For example, although MathML [[mathml3]]
					would intuitively be the most accessible way to add math, it was not well supported in <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] until recently. Its
					rendering in older reading systems still often relies on a JavaScript library that greatly slows the
					presentation the more equations there are to render.</p>

				<p>Despite the past support issues, MathML markup is the optimal way to represent math content because
					it allows for intelligent interpretation and voice rendering by assistive technologies, allows users
					to explore the components of an equation, and even allows copying and pasting of equations into
					external applications. And with improved rendering in newer reading systems, publishers can be
					assured that their content will display as intended.</p>

				<p>When MathML markup is included in a publication, the <dfn id="MathML">MathML</dfn> accessibility
					feature is set in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]]
					metadata.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the MathML feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>

      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Because of the history of poor support for MathML in reading systems, there is also a legacy
						requirement to identify all documents that contain MathML in the <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-manifest">manifest</a> [[epub-3]]. This was to allow reading
						systems to selectively turn on MathJAX rendering without slowing down the rendering of documents
						that had no math, for example, or to present a fallback document with math encoded as images.
						This metadata is not typically exposed to users, so there is still the need to report the
						accessibility feature.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Although ideally all math equations would be represented as MathML, in practice this is often
					impractical to do. Basic math equations can often be represented using ASCII text without any loss
					of information, for example. When claiming that MathML is available as an accessible feature,
					however, all, or substantively all, equations that would be ambiguous in pure text form should be
					represented using MathML markup.</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is another formatting syntax for expressing math
					equations. Unlike MathML, which is XML-based, LaTeX is a typesetting language that uses a system of
					text escapes to format equations.</p>

				<p>When LaTeX is included in an EPUB publication, it is indicated in accessibility metadata using the
						<dfn id="latex">latex</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the latex feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">latex&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Unlike other formal technology names, like MathML and ARIA, the spelling "LaTeX" is not used to
						identify the feature in the schema.org vocabulary. It is strongly recommended to use the
						lowercase vocabulary spelling to avoid issues with processors that are case-sensitive.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Reading systems do not natively support the rendering of LaTeX equations the way they do MathML, but
					it is possible to add a JavaScript library like <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJAX</a> to
					visually render the equations. Due to the lack of consistent support for scripting in EPUB, however,
					most publishers do not include LaTeX formatting directly in their publications. It is more commonly
					found in the source from which an EPUB is generated, and converted to an image for the EPUB,
					otherwise users without a scripting-capable reading system will have to view and read the raw LaTeX
					formatting. As a result, it is not common for the <code>latex</code> feature to be declared in a
					publication's metadata.</p>

				<p>While not the most desirable from an accessibility perspective, it is also possible to provide
					accessible images of math equations if high quality alternative text and descriptions are provided.
					The presence of described images is indicated in the metadata using the <dfn id="describedMath"
						>describedMath</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the described math feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">

      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The problem with describing math images is that human language is often not as precise as the
					equations it tries to describe and there is no way for the user to inspect the original equation to
					try and clarify. For example, the description "the square root of x and y" could be interpreted as
					either taking the square root of x and adding that value to y, or adding x and y together and taking
					the square root of the result.</p>

				<p>Images of math are still prevalent in EPUB, however, because improvements to MathML rendering are
					recent and there are many current and legacy reading systems that do not render MathML well.</p>

				<p>When the <code>describedMath</code> property applies to an EPUB publication, the <a
						href="#alternativeText"><code>alternativeText</code></a> and <a href="#longDescription"
							><code>longDescription</code></a> features are also set, depending on how the math is
					described.</p>

				<p>Audio and video content often require a mix of features to improve their accessibility. While
					audio-only files only have to take their sound into consideration, video content typically mixes
					both important visual information with essential audio. But even a video without any sound may still
					convey information that has to be captured for users.</p>

				<p>The practices for making audio accessible are generally the same regardless of whether the audio is
					part of a video or is a standalone clip. The biggest difference between the two cases is that audio
					with video typically requires more context to be accessible because the video content is also
					presenting important information.</p>

				<p>One of the most common methods for making audio content in EPUBs accessible is by adding captions.
					There are two ways that this can be done: closed captions and open captions.</p>

				<p>Closed captions are when the captions are defined separately from the audio content, allowing users
					to control their appearance and turn them on or off as they prefer. Their presence is indicated in
					the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata using the
						<dfn id="closedCaptions">closedCaptions</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the closed captions feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">closedCaptions&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Although closed captions are most beneficial to users who are deaf or hard of hearing, they can also
					be helpful to users who are blind or have low vision. It is possible for assistive technologies to
					read aloud the captions or render them as braille (although this is not common in <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">EPUB reading systems</a> [[epub-3]]). <a
						href="#audioDescription">Audio descriptions</a> and <a href="#transcript">transcripts</a> are
					generally more helpful for users who cannot see the content.</p>

				<p>The typical way to add closed captions for audio in <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document"
						>XHTML content documents</a> [[epub-3]] is using the [^track^] element [[html]], with [[webvtt]]
					being the most commonly used technology for captioning.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>It is not possible to add closed captions natively to an audio-only clip in HTML. Although the
						[^audio^] element [[html]] supports tracks, unlike the [^video^] element it does not render any
						visual content. To work around this, the [^video^] element can be used to play audio-only clips
						with closed captions.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Open captions are the opposite of closed captions — they are a part of the visual display of a video.
					They cannot be turned off or have their appearance modified, and cannot be accessed by assistive
					technologies. Their presence is indicated in the package document metadata using the <dfn
						id="openCaptions">openCaptions</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the open captions feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">openCaptions&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Open captions are most beneficial to users who are deaf or hard of hearing; they do not make auditory
					content accessible to users who are blind. (While <a href="#signLanguage">sign language
						interpretation</a> is often preferable for users who are deaf, it is not easy to provide as will
					be discussed later in this section.)</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Open captions cannot be used with audio-only clips in HTML unless the audio is rendered as a
						video (e.g., with a black background) in a [[html]] [^video^] element. The [[html]] [^audio^]
						element has no display.</p>
				</div>

				<p>While captions are helpful for those who cannot hear the audio, they are not always the ideal. Many
					users who are deaf are more proficient at reading sign language than they are written text. For
					these users, having an interpreter to translate what is being said on screen is preferable. The
					inclusion of sign language interpretation is indicated in the package document metadata using the
						<dfn id="signLanguage">signLanguage</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the audio descriptions feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">signLanguage&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Similar to captioning, there are two common ways to provide sign language interpretation. One is to
					include the interpreter as part of the video itself, often in a bubble in the lower corner of the
					screen. This method is best used where there is not a lot of action (e.g., for a person giving a
					speech) as it can obscure what is happening for all users.</p>

				<p>The other method is to provide sign language interpretation in a separate video and link the two
					video elements so that they play back together. This method is problematic for ebooks both because
					HTML does not have a method of synchronizing two video elements (it would require scripting, which
					is not well supported in reading systems) and also because the author cannot know how the videos
					will be laid out and paginated (the sign language interpreter could end up on a separate page from
					the video). It is not common to find sign language interpretation in EPUBs for these reasons.</p>

				<p>Another drawback of captions is that they only capture auditory content. For users who cannot see
					what is happening in a video, the context of what is occurring on screen is lost when only captions
					are provided. Audio descriptions fill this gap by describing what is happening visually (e.g. actor
					movements or expressions). Their presence is indicated in the package document metadata using the
						<dfn id="audioDescription">audioDescription</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the audio descriptions feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">audioDescription&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Another common method of making both the audio and video content accessible is through a transcript.
					A transcript, like an audio descriptions, can also describe more than just what is being said. For
					example, it can be structured more like a screenplay. For this reason, they are also useful for
					explaining what is happening in video-only content like animated instructional videos. When
					transcripts are provided, their presence is indicated in the package document metadata using the
						<dfn id="transcript">transcript</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the transcript feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">transcript&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The one drawback of using transcripts is that they are not available in real time like captions and
					audio descriptions. As a result, users who can see the content but not hear it may have to watch the
					video once in silence and then try to match up through memory what they are reading in the
					transcript against what they just watched. Even with detailed transcripts that include the actions
					to help orient the user, the time to process the video is greatly increased.</p>

				<p>A final audio consideration for users who are hard of hearing or have difficult processing speech is
					to provide greater contrast between spoken content and background noises. High contrast audio refers
					to audio of speech that has no background noise, that maintains a difference of at least 20 decibels
					between the foreground speech and background noise, or that allows users to turn off any background
					noise. Its presence is indicated in the package document metadata using the <dfn
						id="highContrastAudio">highContrastAudio</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the high contrast audio feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">highContrastAudio&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>For specific details on evaluating when auditory content meets the requirements to be classified as
					high contrast, refer to [[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#low-or-no-background-audio">success criterion
						1.4.7</a>. Not all audio has to meet this requirement, for example. The audio must be primarily
					speech and there is an exemption for musical content.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Information about how the audio meets the requirement should be provided in the accessibility
						summary (i.e., there is no background noise, at least 20db difference between foreground speech
						and background noise, or the background noise can be turned off.)</p>
				</div>

				<p><a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> [[epub-3]] will often contain a mix
					of the above features to make audio and video content accessible. It is not required to pick only
					one feature for all audio and video clips, nor should publishers feel they have to limit themselves
					to providing only one accessible alternative per clip. As already discussed, different users will
					prefer different options.</p>

					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>EPUB requires that every publication provide a table of contents in the navigation document, so it is
					almost always possible to claim the <dfn id="tableOfContents">tableOfContents</dfn> accessibility
					feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the table of contents feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">tableOfContents&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The only time it would not be appropriate to claim <code>tableOfContents</code> is if the table of
					contents is incomplete &#8212; for example, if a publisher only links to one chapter to meet the
					absolute minimum requirements for a table of contents to be valid.</p>

				<p>It is not required that the table of contents provide links to every sublevel heading in the
					publication. If the publisher wants to keep the table of contents in the navigation document simpler
					for <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a> [[epub-3]] use, they can also
					provide a more detailed table of contents in a regular <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content document</a> in the publication <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-spine">spine</a> [[epub-3]]. The <code>tableOfContents</code> value
					does not only apply to the table of contents in the navigation document, although this is the one
					most easily accessed by users.</p>

				<p>Providing users access into the major sections of the publication through the table of contents is
					one of EPUB 3's built-in methods of meeting the [[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#multiple-ways"
						>multiple ways success criterion</a>, the other being via the page-to-page navigation offered
					from the spine. Publishers should also consider adding indexes to make it easier for users to more
					rapidly locate specific information of interest. These can include general indexes, such as by
					subject or name, or more content-specific indexes, such as an index of recipes for a cookbook.</p>

				<p>The presence of an index is indicated in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package
						document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata using the <dfn id="feature-index">index</dfn> accessibility
					feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the index feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">index&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The type of index provided does not matter when setting the <code>index</code> feature, but to set
					the feature the index must provide hyperlinks to the reference locations in the work or, if the
					index cites page numbers, must include a page list so that users can use it to navigate to the page
					references that way. If no method of accessing the reference locations is provided, the
						<code>index</code> feature must not be set.</p>

				<p>Another method for users of assistive technologies to navigate a publication is through ARIA
					landmarks [[wai-aria]]. These are expressed using the [[html]] [^/role^] attribute and, particularly
					for EPUB, using the roles in the DPUB-ARIA extension [[dpub-aria]]. When an XHTML content document
					is loaded, assistive technology typically check for the presence of landmark roles and provide users
					with a quick navigation menu.</p>

				<p>The presence of ARIA landmarks is indicated in the package document metadata using the <dfn id="ARIA"
						>ARIA</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the ARIA feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">ARIA&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>ARIA landmarks should be used sparingly as their usefulness diminishes the more there are in a
					document. On the web, they are used to direct users to the major components of a page's layout, such
					as the banner, search bar, navigation menu, main body, etc. A common mistake with publications is to
					replicate the entire table of contents as landmarks. Such practice is not helpful as the
					hierarchical structure of the sections and subsections in the page is lost when using landmarks —
					the landmark links are always presented as a single flat list; there is no ability to nest levels
					like in a table of contents. A general rule of thumb for ARIA is that the usefulness of landmarks
					begins to diminish once you have more than a half-dozen or so in a page.</p>

				<p>The final accessible navigation feature is the ability to move through the structure of a publication
					by heading level in the markup. When headings are properly marked up using the [[html]]
						<code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code> elements, it is possible for reading systems and
					assistive technologies to provide users hotkeys that allow them to move to the next heading.</p>

				<p>The provision of structural navigation by heading is indicated in the package document metadata using
					the <dfn id="structuralNavigation">structuralNavigation</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the structural navigation feature">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="schema:accessibilityFeature">structuralNavigation&lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>This feature is similar to having a table of contents but does not require the user to leave their
					current position and search the table of contents to skip forward to the next heading.</p>

				<p>Publications that claim to provide structural navigation should ensure that the number of each
					heading element used matches the hierarchy of the heading within the publication. Although this is
					not required to conform to the [[wcag2]] <a data-cite="wcag2#info-and-relationships">info and
						relationships success criterion</a>, claiming structural navigation is more than just ensuring
					some heading tag has been used to identify each heading.</p>

				<p>Some minor deviations from this rule are acceptable so long as the variations are consistent and
					users are informed of the change in structure in the accessibility summary or in front matter on how
					to use the book. For example, some publishers set a specific starting level for all their sidebars,
					such as &lt;h3>, regardless of the heading level the sidebar falls under.</p>

				<p>Whether an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] is produced
					with a print equivalent or not, being able to locate and move to static page break locations is an
					important feature to help users navigate the content. It is useful in educational settings, for
					example, where users who are blind might use an EPUB to read an assignment instead of the print
					version their peers are using.</p>

				<p>The first feature for identifying static pagination is static page break markers. These markers are
					inserted into the markup <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content
						documents</a> [[epub-3]] using the <a data-cite="dpub-aria#doc-pagebreak"
							><code>doc-pagebreak</code> role</a> [[dpub-aria]] to make them readable by assistive
					technologies.</p>

				<p>Static page break markers, as their name suggests, do not change depending on the device being used
					or the font and spacing preferences of the user. The pagination built into many <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] is not static because
					it changes depending on these display factors.</p>

				<p>The presence of static page break markers is indicated in the <a

						accessibility benefits.</p>
					<p>The <code>pageBreakMarkers</code> feature must not be set if only the <code>epub:type</code>
						attribute is specified.</p>
				</div>

				<p>It is not required that every page break marker from the source be present, or that they be in the
					same order as the source, as digital publications often omit material that is only relevant to print
					and have front and back matter rearranged. The markers for blank pages at the end of chapters and
					sections are also often omitted from digital publications. When page markers are omitted, the
					accessibility summary should be used to explain why.</p>

				<p>If the page breaks markers provided have limited utility, the <code>pageBreakMarkers</code> feature
					should not be claimed. For example, if only the page breaks at the start of chapters are identified,
					the ability to synchronize reading is no better than what the table of contents will provide. At a
					minimum, if the feature is claimed in cases like this, the limitation must be explained in the
					accessibility summary.</p>

				<p>While static page break markers can be useful on their own, they are most commonly paired with a page
					list to allow users to quickly find a destination. The page list, as its name suggests, is a list of
					hyperlinks to each static page break location.</p>

				<p>The presence of a page list is indicated in the package document metadata using the <dfn
						id="pageNavigation">pageNavigation</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the page navigation feature">

				</aside>

				<p>Similar to page break markers, a page list is most useful when it includes links to all the static
					page break locations. If the list is incomplete because blank pages or certain front or back matter
					is omitted, the summary should explain why. If the page list is mostly incomplete, such as when page
					breaks are only provided for chapter start locations, it is recommended not to claim it as an
					accessibility feature.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>It is not required that a page list link to static page break markers identified by an [[html]]
						[^/role^] or <code>epub:type</code> attribute values. A destination ID for each page break
						location is all that is required.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Regardless of whether static page break markers or a page list, or both, are included, the source of
					the pagination needs to be identified, even when there is no source (EPUBs with no print or other
					statically paginated version). As there may be multiple print editions of a work, all with different
					pagination, it is important for users to know which one the EPUB's pagination matches up with.</p>

				<p>The source of the pagination is identified in a <dfn id="a11y:pageBreakSource"
						>a11y:pageBreakSource</dfn> property. It is recommended to use a unique identifier such as an
					ISBN or ISSN to identify the source, when available.</p>

				</div>

				<p>The absence of digital rights management (DRM) schemes is a critical accessibility feature as it
					ensures that users can access the content with their preferred <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] and assistive
					technologies, which might otherwise be blocked by encryption. It also allows for personal use and
					transformations of the content that may be necessary for a user to perceive and understand it (e.g.,
					using it with specialized text-to-speech software).</p>

				<p>That a publication is not DRM protected is indicated in the <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata using the <dfn
						id="unlocked">unlocked</dfn> accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the unlocked feature">

				<p>Do not set the <code>unlocked</code> feature unless it is known for certain that the publication will
					be available to users without DRM. If, for example, the publication will be sent to a distributor
					who will pass it on to multiple vendors, some of whom may apply DRM to the publication, the feature
					must not be set, even if it might be true in some cases.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The use of DRM does not mean that a publication will not be usable by assistive technologies.
						When DRM is applied, publishers should ensure that they do not add restrictions that could
						affect access, but even when this is done vendor DRM could still have impacts on the
						usability.</p>

				<div class="feature-list">
					<p class="feature-hd">In this section:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#readingOrder">readingOrder</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>It is important to indicate if an EPUB has a defined reading order in the markup because it ensures
					that users of assistive technologies can follow the narrative in order. When the visual presentation
					of the content does not match the order in the markup, it makes it harder for non-visual readers to
					understand the text.</p>

				<p>The presence of a reading order is indicated in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document"
						>package document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata using the <dfn id="readingOrder">readingOrder</dfn>
					accessibility feature.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the reading order feature">

&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Unlike many of the other accessibility features, where claims can be made even if coverage is not
					complete, the <code>readingOrder</code> feature must not be set unless the entire work conforms.
					Users cannot be expected to read the accessibility summary for problems with the reading order and
					then have to make sense of the mis-ordered content.</p>

				<p>The lack of a logical reading order at the markup level most commonly occurs in fixed layout EPUBs.
					Reasons why include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>the fixed layout canvas makes it easy to use CSS to position elements in a sequence that is
						detached from the markup;</li>
					<li>the nature of spreads (two pages side-by-side) allows publishers to create visual reading
						experiences that cross from one page to the next and back (for example, a sidebar that spans the
						bottom of a page).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Reflowable EPUBs typically do not have issues with their markup not reflecting the visual reading
					order, as there is less control over the layout position of content. But it is possible to create
					reading sequences that are out of order on a smaller scale than a page, as content can be positioned
					in a fixed manner within container elements. For example, a sidebar element could be given a fixed
					width and height and have elements positioned within that space.</p>

				<p>Ruby annotations are used as pronunciation guides for logographic characters in languages like
					Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). They make difficult CJK ideographic characters more accessible
					for language learners, native speakers of all reading levels, and people with reading disabilities.
					They also provide critical information for text-to-speech (TTS) engines.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Ruby annotations are implemented by attaching the [[html]] [^ruby^] tag to ideographic characters
						to provide the annotation. The [^rt^] tag contains the phonetic reading of the base character in
						the <code>ruby</code> tag.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Unlike other accessibility features, ruby annotations distinguish between publications that provide
					full coverage and partial coverage of all ideographic characters. This is because it is common for
					CJK publishers to provide different coverage options based on reader need. Publications with partial
					coverage target pronunciation support for rarer characters, proper nouns, or key terms without
					cluttering the text with ruby on every single character.</p>

				<p>The presence of full ruby coverage, where all ideographic characters have annotations, is indicated
					in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata using the

				<p>As <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publications</a> [[epub-3]] can be read on

				<p><strong>Do not</strong> use the <code>braille</code> feature for publications whose primary format is
					braille. The <a href="https://daisy.org/s/ebraille/">eBraille format</a>, for example, is designed
					to represent braille character data in an EPUB-conformant package. It is not necessary to declare
					that an eBraille file has a <code>braille</code> feature since the format itself and its required
					metadata already make this fact clear. The <code>braille</code> feature is expected only when
					braille character data supplements the standard text.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>Another advantage of the eBraille format is that it provides metadata to indicate the type of
						braille being included (language, code, grade, etc.). When braille is added to a standard EPUB,
						the accessibility summary is likely the only reliable way to provide this information to users,
						as distributors and <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]]
						are unlikely to check or report braille metadata.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Both eBraille and standard EPUB publications may contain tactile graphics. These are images that are

					printing the images (embossing) or rendering them on specialized refreshable braille devices.</p>

				<p>The presence of tactile graphics is indicated in the package document metadata using the <dfn

				<aside class="example" title="Package document markup for the tactile graphic feature">

				<p>Although it may seem counterintuitive that a digital format like EPUB could contain a tactile object,

				<p>Word segmentation refers to whether additional spacing is added to languages that do not normally use

			<h2>Accessibility hazards</h2>

			<section id="hazards-setting">
				<h3>Setting hazards</h3>

				<p>There are three types of hazards that can affect readers of digital content:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>flashing — if a resource flashes more than three times a second, it can cause seizures (e.g.,
							videos and animations).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>motion simulation — if a resource simulates motion, it can cause a user to become nauseated
							(e.g., a video game drawn on the [[html]] <a data-lt="canvas"
								><code>canvas</code> element</a> or parallax scrolling with CSS).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>sound — certain sound patterns, such as ringing and buzzing, can cause seizures, while loud
							or sudden changes in volume can also negatively affect users.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It is not only important for users to be aware if these hazards are present, but also if they are not
					present or if their status is unknown. Without this information, users would have no way of knowing
					if a publication is free from hazards or simply has not been checked, potentially leading them to
					obtain content which could be physically harmful to them.</p>

				<p>To allow for complete metadata declarations, each of the hazards defined above can be in three
					different ways:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>When hazards are present, the <a href="#flashing"><code>flashing</code></a>, <a
							href="#motionSimulation"><code>motionSimulation</code></a>, and <a href="#sound"
								><code>sound</code></a> values can be declared.</li>
					<li>When hazards are not present, the values to use are <a href="#noFlashingHazard"
								><code>noFlashingHazard</code></a>, <a href="#noMotionSimulationHazard"
								><code>noMotionSimulationHazard</code></a>, and <a href="#noSoundHazard"
								><code>noSoundHazard</code></a>.</li>
					<li>When hazards are not known, the values to use are <a href="#unknownFlashingHazard"
								><code>unknownFlashingHazard</code></a>, <a href="#unknownMotionSimulationHazard"
								><code>unknownMotionSimulationHazard</code></a>, and <a href="#unknownSoundHazard"
								><code>unknownSoundHazard</code></a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Each hazard status is identified in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package
						document</a> [[epub-3]] using a <a href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"><dfn
							id="schema:accessibilityHazard"><code>schema:accessibilityHazard</code></dfn> property</a>
					[[schema-org]]. The property is repeated for each status &#8212; do not group all the hazard
					statuses into a single tag.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata for a publication with only a flashing hazard">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   flashing
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   noMotionSimulationHazard
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   noSoundHazard
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>These values can be paired together to identify each risk but authors have to ensure they do not
					accidentally declare conflicting statements for the same hazard type. For example,
						<code>flashing</code>, <code>noFlashingHazard</code> and <code>unknownFlashingHazard</code> must
					never be declared together in the same publication.</p>

				<p>To help simplify authoring hazard metadata, there are also two global values that can be
					declared:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>When there are no hazards of any type, the value <a href="#hazard-none"><code>none</code></a>
						can be declared instead of setting a status for each individual hazard type.</li>
					<li>When none of the possible hazards is known, the value <a href="#hazard-unknown"
								><code>unknown</code></a> can be declared instead of setting a status for each
						individual hazard type.</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="example" title="Metadata for a publication with no hazards">
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="schema:accessibilityHazard">
   none
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>These values are mutually exclusive and must never be declared for the same publication. Also, when
					either of these global values is declared, no individual hazard statuses should be declared as it is
					likely to cause conflicting statements and confuse users. For example, when <code>none</code> is
					declared, the <code>flashing</code>, <code>motionSimulation</code>, and <code>sound</code> hazards
					must not also be declared, nor any of their unknown value equivalents. Best practice is to never mix
					a global declaration with individual ones, even if they technically do not conflict.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>It is not strictly an error to declare redundant statements. The <code>none</code> value could,
						for example, be paired with <code>noFlashingHazard</code>, <code>noMotionSimulationHazard</code>
						and/or <code>noSoundHazard</code>, since these statements are stating the same thing
							(<code>none</code> is equivalent to declaring the three individual statements). But it is
						strongly advised not to include redundant statements as they add no value and can lead to errors
						in the future if the hazard statuses have to change.</p>
				</div>

				<p>If an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] contains a hazard,
					or if the presence of a hazard type is not known, provide additional information in the <a
						href="#accessibilitySummary">accessibility summary</a>. For hazards, this could include where
					the hazard occurs (both location within the publication and the point within the resource, when
					applicable). For unknown hazards, the reason why the hazard is not known should be stated, as well
					as whether and when a future update to the publication will provide more information.</p>

				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>[[[epub-a11y]]] [[epub-a11y]] defines metadata for indicating whether a publication meets its
					conformance requirements, as well as how to report information such as who performed the evaluation,
					what credentials the evaluator holds, and who to contact for more information about the
					accessibility of a publication.</p>

				<p>Although this metadata is not as descriptive as the schema.org properties, it is just as important to
					set. Reporting accessibility conformance to an accepted standard shows users that the content is
					broadly accessible without them having to go through all the specific features and access modes. The
					level of conformance, whether WCAG 2 Level A or AA, also provides insight into the user groups that
					will benefit from the accessibility affordances provided.</p>

				<p>Reporting conformance also directly benefits publishers as it establishes trust with their customers.
					When customers see that a publisher consistently does the work to make their content accessible,
					they are more likely to seek out content from that publisher.</p>

				<p>Reporting accessibility conformance is also important at a regulatory level. Many jurisdictions now
					have laws around the provision of accessible content. Indicating that a publication is conforming
					and providing details about the evaluation is often not optional metadata.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="conformance-claims">
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For historical reasons, the EPUB accessibility vocabulary uses "certifier" and "certified" in the
						names of its properties. No official authority was intended from this choice of name, but it
						often causes confusion in regions where certification has legal meaning. The conformance
						metadata is only intended to describe an evaluator performing an evaluation of the content,
						which is why this document uses to the "evaluator" concepts to describe their uses.</p>
				</div>

				<section id="conformance-statement">
					<h4>Conformance statement</h4>

					<p>When an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] meets the
						discovery and accessibility requirements of [[[epub-a11y]]] [[epub-a11y]], a conformance claim
						can be made using the <a
							href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#conformsTo"><dfn
								id="dcterms:conformsTo">dcterms:conformsTo</dfn> property</a> [[dcterms]].</p>

					<p>The EPUB Accessibility specification defines a <a data-cite="epub-a11y#sec-conf-reporting-pub"
							>controlled vocabulary of values</a> [[epub-a11y]] that are allowed in the conformance
						statement. These values follow the pattern:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>the name and version of the EPUB Accessibility specification being conformed to (e.g., "EPUB
							Accessibility 1.2")</li>
						<li>a space-separated hyphen (" - ");</li>
						<li>the version and level of WCAG 2 that is met by the content (e.g., "WCAG 2.2 Level AA")</li>
					</ol>

					<aside class="example" title="Common conformance declarations">
						<pre>&lt;meta property="dcterms:conformsTo">EPUB Accessibility 1.1 -  WCAG 2.0 Level AA&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta property="dcterms:conformsTo">EPUB Accessibility 1.1 -  WCAG 2.1 Level AA&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta property="dcterms:conformsTo">EPUB Accessibility 1.1 -  WCAG 2.2 Level AA&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta property="dcterms:conformsTo">EPUB Accessibility 1.2 -  WCAG 2.2 Level A&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta property="dcterms:conformsTo">EPUB Accessibility 1.2 -  WCAG 2.2 Level AA&lt;/meta></pre>
					</aside>

					<div class="note">
						<p>These patterns only apply to EPUB Accessibility 1.1 [[epub-a11y-11]] specification and above.
							The <a href="https://idpf.org/epub/a11y/">EPUB Accessibility 1.0</a> [[epub-a11y-10]]
							specification was produced by a different organization and used URLs to identify
							conformance.</p>
						<p>Conforming to the 1.0 standard is no longer recommended both due to its age and because it
							allowed conformance claims to WCAG 2 without fully meeting the requirements of that
							standard. Claiming conformance to EPUB Accessibility 1.0 makes it ambiguous whether the
							content is fully conforming which can prove problematic where accessibility is mandated by
							law.</p>
					</div>

					<p>It is important to ensure that an EPUB publication fully meets the requirements of the EPUB
						Accessibility specification and the version and level of WCAG specified. It is not sufficient,
						for example, to make a conformance claim based solely on an EPUB publication passing an
						automated conformance checker. While these tools are helpful for finding machine-identifiable
						issues, there are many checks that only a human can carry out.</p>

					<p>Although omitted from the previous examples for simplicity of reading, it is typical for a
						conformance claim <code>meta</code> tag to also declare an <code>id</code>. As will be detailed
						in the following sections, the ID assigned to the tag allows other statements to be attached to
						it, such as <a href="#evaluator">who performed the evaluation</a> and, when present, the <a
							href="#report-date">date of the evaluation</a> and where a <a href="#certifier-report"
							>detailed report</a> can be found.</p>

					<p>There is currently no standardized way to state that a publication fails conformance reporting,
						as publishers typically omit any claims when a publication fails to meet minimum standards. One
						option is to use the word "none" in a <code>dctems:conformsTo</code> statement, but this might
						not be recognized as an accessibility claim if it is not accompanied by other evaluator
						information. It could also cause display issues in bookstores and <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]], as they will not
						expect a failing conformance statement and, for example, would not translate or modify the value
						to make more sense for users.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The <code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property is not exclusive to making accessibility claims.
							It can be used to make other types of claims, including additional accessibility claims
							(e.g., to a publisher's internal conformance standard or to another regional accessibility
							standard).</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section id="evaluator">
					<h4>Adding an evaluator's name</h4>

					<p>Providing the name of the evaluator is required when a conformance claim is made. It is helpful
						to users in terms of assessing the quality of the evaluation performed. A user might be warier
						of a publisher self-certifying their work, for example, especially if they do not declare any <a
							href="#credential">evaluation credentials</a>, than a trusted evaluation agency.</p>

					<p>The name of the evaluator is provided in the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package
							document</a> [[epub-3]] metadata using the <a data-cite="epub-a11y#certifiedBy"><dfn
								id="a11y:certifiedBy">a11y:certifiedBy</dfn> property</a> [[epub-a11y]]. It is strongly
						recommended to attach the evaluator name to the conformance statement using the
							<code>refines</code> attribute, where the value of the attribute is a reference to the ID of
						the conformance claim.</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Evaluator of a conformance claim identified">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>

      &lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>It is only necessary to add an ID to the <code>meta</code> tag for the evaluator's name if a
						credential, certification date, or the location of a more detailed report is also going to be
						specified. Otherwise, it can be omitted.</p>

					<p>If multiple parties performed an evaluation, it is possible to provide more than one
							<code>a11y:certifiedBy</code> property that links back to the conformance claim, but there
						is no guarantee if all, or even which one, will be displayed in a bookstore or <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system's</a> [[epub-3]] metadata. As per
						the recommendation for other EPUB metadata, such as author names, it is advised to put all the
						names in one tag if it is important that they all be displayed.</p>

					<p>It is also possible to provide the evaluator's name in another language or script in EPUB 3
						publications using the <a data-cite="epub-3#alternate-script"><code>alternate-script</code>

					<h4>Adding the evaluation date</h4>

					<p>Although users will typically assume that an evaluation was performed prior to the release of an
							<a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]], it can be
						helpful to users to have the date explicitly stated. More often, though, this date is helpful
						for the publisher to be able to determine when an evaluation was last performed.</p>

					<p>The date of the evaluation is attached to the evaluator's name metadata using a <a
							href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/#date"><dfn
								id="dcterms:date">dcterms:date</dfn> property</a> [[dcterms]]. The format of the data
						must be expressed as an [[iso8601-1]] conforming date string. These typically take the form of a
						single four-digit year, a four-digit year followed by a two-digit month, or a four-digit year
						followed by a two-digit month followed by a two-digit day (with hyphens used to separate the
						values in all cases).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Evaluator of a conformance claim identified">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">

   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>More information about the recommended date format can be found in [[[datetime]]]
						[[datetime]].</p>

					<p>When including an evaluation date, it is important to remember to update it if the publication is
						re-evaluated (e.g., for a revised release). Do not add a second <code>dcterms:date</code>
						property for the new date as it could lead to the wrong information being displayed to
						users.</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>Although the date format allows a time to be included after the date, in general there is
							little value in providing such detailed information. The time portion of the date string is
							also unlikely to be presented to users, so adding a time would only have value for internal
							processes.</p>

					<h4>Adding an evaluator's report</h4>

					<p>When performing a conformance evaluation, a detailed report is often produced to prove that a
						publication meets all the requirements of the EPUB Accessibility specification and WCAG success
						criteria. Making this report available can aid users who need more detailed information about
						the content and may be legally necessary to provide in order to sell a publication.</p>

					<p>When a detailed report is available, it is possible to link to it from the <a
							data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> [[epub-3]]. Unlike the other
						conformance metadata, however, the link is provided in a <code>link</code> element using the <a
							data-cite="epub-a11y#certifierReport"><dfn id="a11y:certifierReport"
								>a11y:certifierReport</dfn> property</a> [[epub-a11y]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Link to a detailed evaluation report">
						<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta id="evaluator" property="a11y:certifiedBy">
         John Doe Evaluation Services

   …
&lt;/package></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>Ensure that the report is hosted in a publicly readable location. Providing a link to an internal
						publisher document, for example, will prevent users from accessing it. The link should be stable
						so that the report remains accessible over time and to prevent security issues (e.g., to prevent
						broken-link hijacking when a domain expires and gets bought by a malicious party).</p>

					<div class="note">
						<p>It is possible to include a copy of the report in the <a
								data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] if it cannot be
							hosted on a secure, public server. Including reports in the EPUB container is not common
							practice, however, because it increases the difficulty to access it. Vendors and <a
								data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] would have to
							extract the report and put it someplace accessible so that users can read it prior to buying
							or opening a publication. Otherwise, the only option is for the user to unzip the EPUB
							publication and locate the report themselves.</p>

						<p>When embedding a report, the <code>link</code> element's <code>href</code> attribute would
							contain a relative path to the location of the file in the zip container. Because the report
							is not a publication resource, it does not have to be listed in the <a
								data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-manifest">manifest</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

			<section id="conformance-exemption">
				<h3>Conformance exemptions</h3>

				<p>In jurisdictions where accessibility conformance is mandated by law, it is also possible that some
					publishers are granted exemptions from full conformance. Exemptions may be granted, for example, for
					small and self-publishers who cannot afford the full costs of making their publications accessible
					or for content that cannot be made accessible without fundamentally altering its presentation.</p>

				<p>The <a data-cite="epub-a11y-exemption#exemption-property"><dfn id="a11y:exemption"
							>a11y:exemption</dfn> property</a> [[epub-a11y-exemption]] is used in these cases to
					indicate that an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] is
					exempt from a jurisdiction's accessibility requirements.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Publication claiming a European Accessibility Act exemption">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …
      &lt;meta property="a11y:exemption">
         eaa-microenterprise
      &lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>A publication can fail the minimum accessibility requirements for a jurisdiction while still meeting
					the minimum conformance requirements of the EPUB Accessibility standard. This is because conformance
					claims can be made when a publication meet WCAG 2 Level A while most legislations requires Level AA
					conformance. For this reason, the exemption is not linked to a conformance claim or an evaluator
					using the <code>refines</code> attribute.</p>

				<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj">European
						Accessibility Act (EAA)</a> is the only legislation known to provide these types of exemptions.
					Publications must meet the minimum accessibility requirements of the Act or fall under one of the
					following three exemptions in order to be distributed within the bloc of member countries:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>disproportionate burden &#8212; the accessibility requirements of the Act <q>shall apply only to
							the extent that compliance: … (b) does not result in the imposition of a disproportionate
							burden on the economic operators concerned</q>. An exemption under this clause is declared
						using the value "<code>eaa-disproportionate-burden</code>".</li>
					<li>fundamental alteration &#8212; the accessibility requirements of the Act <q>shall apply only to
							the extent that compliance: (a) does not require a significant change in a product or
							service that results in the fundamental alteration of its basic nature</q>. An exemption
						under this clause is declared using the value "<code>eaa-fundamental-alteration</code>".</li>
					<li>microenterprise &#8212; the accessibility requirements of the Act do not apply to <q>an
							enterprise which employs fewer than 10 persons and which has an annual turnover not
							exceeding EUR 2 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 2 million</q>. An
						exemption under this clause is declared using the value "<code>eaa-microenterprise</code>".</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Publishers should seek legal advice before claiming any exemption to EAA rules. Exemptions may also
					be time-limited and require a periodic reassessment to confirm that they still apply.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="contact-email">
				<h3>Adding contact info</h3>

				<p>Providing a contact email address for accessibility inquiries is another helpful way to establish
					trust with users. While conformance and discovery metadata provide a useful picture of the
					accessibility of a publication, it cannot cover every need. Before purchasing content, users may
					want to reach out to the publisher for more information.</p>

				<p>A contact email is also a helpful way for publishers to gather feedback on the actual accessibility
					of their content. Sometimes inaccessible content will slip through quality assurance testing. And
					while user testing before release, is ideal, it is not always possible and cannot verify every
					user's needs are met.</p>

				<p>The email address to use to contact the publisher is specified in an <a
						data-cite="epub-a11y#contactEmail"><dfn id="a11y:contactEmail">a11y:contactEmail</dfn>
						property</a> [[epub-a11y]].</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Contact email">
					<pre>&lt;package xmlns="http://www.idpf.org/2007/opf" xml:lang="en">
   &lt;metadata>
      …

      &lt;/meta>
      …
   &lt;/metadata>
   …
&lt;/package></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The contact email does not have to go to the publisher. If they use a third-party that is responsible
					for the accessibility of their products, that party's address can be used. The key point is that the
					email should go directly to someone who can handle accessibility requests. It should not be a
					general-purpose feedback address unless there is no other option.</p>

			<h2>Identifying accessibility features</h2>

			<p>This appendix provides guidance on how to determine if an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB
					publication</a> [[epub-3]] contains accessibility features for anyone unfamiliar with their markup
				or styling.</p>

			<section id="identify-alt">
				<h3>Alternative text</h3>

				<p>To check if the <a href="#alternativeText"><code>alternativeText</code></a> accessibility can be
					applied requires checking all <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content
						documents</a>.</p>

				<p>It is generally easy to determine if <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content
						documents</a> [[epub-3]] have alternative text, as it only requires checking that an [[html]]
					[^img/alt^] attribute is present on each non-decorative [^img^] tag.</p>

				<pre>&lt;img src="images/hawk.jpg" 
     alt="A majestic hawk perches on a tree branch" /></pre>

				<p>For <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-svg-content-document">SVG content documents</a> [[epub-3]], the
					alternative text is usually contained in the <a data-cite="svg2/struct.html#TitleElement"
							><code>title</code> element</a> [[svg2]]. If there is a <a
						data-cite="svg2/struct.html#DescElement"><code>desc</code> element</a> [[svg2]], it typically
					contains the extended description.</p>

				<pre>&lt;svg …>
   &lt;title>A majestic hawk perches on a tree branch&lt;/title>
   …
&lt;/svg></pre>
			</section>

			<section id="identify-aria">
				<h3>ARIA structural roles</h3>

				<p>To check if the <a href="#ARIA"><code>ARIA</code></a> accessibility feature applies to an <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]], it is necessary to
					determine if structural roles have been used. This first requires searching the <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content documents</a> [[epub-3]] for
					instances of the [[html]] [^/role^] attribute:</p>

				<aside class="example" title="DPUB-ARIA chapter role">
					<pre>&lt;section id="c01" role="doc-chapter" aria-labelledby="c01-hd">
   &lt;h2 id="c01-hd">A new beginning...&lt;/h2>
   …
&lt;/section></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>Next, the type of role has to be verified. The feature only applies when roles have a
						<code>doc-</code> prefix &#8212; which indicates they are from [[dpub-aria]] &#8212; or are
					taken from the [[wai-aria]] <a data-cite="wai-aria#document_structure_roles">document structure</a>
					or <a data-cite="wai-aria#landmark_roles">landmark</a> categories.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>EPUB 2 did not support the use of ARIA markup so this feature would never be declared.</p>

			<section id="identify-audio-desc">
				<h3>Audio descriptions</h3>

				<p>To determine if the <a href="#audioDescription"><code>audioDescription</code></a> feature applies to
					an <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]], search the for
					[[html]] [^track^] elements with their [^track/kind^] attribute set to the value
						"<code>descriptions</code>".</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Audio description provided via ah HTML track">

					the <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content documents</a> [[epub-3]] in the
					publication for [[html]] [^track^] elements with their [^track/kind^] attribute set to

				</aside>

				<p>Make sure that the <code>track</code> elements are not associated with an [[html]] [^audio^] element.

				<p>There are many ways to associate extended descriptions with visual content, so it typically requires
					checking images manually to determine if the <a href="#longDescription"
						><code>longDescription</code></a> feature applies.</p>

				<p>Some common patterns to search for include the presence of an <code>aria-describedby</code> of
						<code>aria-details</code> attribute on an <code>img</code> tag, but these attributes may not
					always be set even when a description is available. As descriptions are often stored in a separate
					file, it is also common to find a hyperlink after an image to its description. The description could
					also be contained in a <code>figcaption</code> element if the image is in a <code>figure</code>.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Extended description using aria-details">
					<pre>&lt;figure>
  &lt;img src="complex-chart.jpg"
       alt="Annual sales growth bar graph"
       aria-details="sales-long-description">

  &lt;details id="sales-long-description">
    &lt;summary>Detailed description of sales growth chart&lt;/summary>
    This bar graph illustrates the company's annual sales growth from 2019 to 2023.
    The vertical axis represents revenue in millions of dollars …
  &lt;/details>
&lt;/figure></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>When checking for the presence of extended descriptions, also check that they have not been omitted
					from visual content that requires them. If a publisher does not provide complete coverage, the
					applicability of the feature has to be assessed.</p>

				<h3>High contrast audio</h3>

				<p>The applicability of the <a href="#highContrastAudio"><code>highContrastAudio</code></a> feature
					cannot be determined from markup alone. The presence of audio and video can be checked by searching
					for the [[html]] [^audio^] and [^video^] elements, but testing for audio contrast typically requires
					an audio analysis tool (unless there is no background noise).</p>

				<h3>High contrast display</h3>

				<p>The applicability of the <a href="#highContrastDisplay"><code>highContrastDisplay</code></a> feature

			</section>

			<section id="identify-index">
				<h3>Indexes</h3>

				<p>For the <a href="#feature-index"><code>index</code></a> feature, the fastest way to check for indexes
					is to look in the table of contents.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, they could be discovered by searching for [[html]] [^nav^] or [^section^] tags with a
					[^/role^] attribute value of <a data-cite="dpub-aria#doc-index"><code>doc-index</code></a>
					[[dpub-aria]].</p>

				<p>Beyond just being present, they also need to be inspected to see if they are hyperlinked.</p>

			<section id="identify-latex">
				<h3>LaTeX formatting</h3>

				<p>As LaTeX is a text-based formatting language, the only way to identify if the <a href="#latex"
							><code>latex</code></a> feature applies is to search each <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a> [[epub-3]].</p>

				<p>Unfortunately, latex formatting does not always begin with a consistent sequence of characters.
					Equations can be wrapped in any of the following depending on whether they are to be rendered inline
					or as block equations:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>$…$</code></li>
					<li><code>\(…\)</code></li>
					<li><code>\[…\]</code></li>
					<li><code>\begin{xzy}…\end{xyz}</code></li>
				</ul>

				<div class="note">
					<p>In the last example, "<code>xyz</code>" is a palceholder for a specific latex formatting command,
						like "<code>math</code>" or "<code>equation</code>".</p>
				</div>

				<p>For example, the quadratic equation could be represented as:</p>

				<pre>\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]</pre>

				<p>or as:</p>

				<pre>$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$</pre>

				<p>Regardless of how the LaTeX syntax is formatted, whether it is being used for <a href="#math">math
						equations</a> or <a href="#chemistry">chemical equations</a> needs to be determined so that the
					appropriate accessibility feature is flagged.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>EPUB 2 publications did not support the scripting necessary to transform LaTeX for presentation.
						Inspecting these publications for equations is generally a waste of time.</p>

			<section id="identify-large-print">
				<h3>Large print</h3>

				<p>The best way to determine if the <a href="#largePrint"><code>largePrint</code></a> feature applies is
					to rely on the publisher's description. Large print books are usually labeled as such.</p>

				<p>It may be possible to read the default styles applied to the content to determine the overall font
					size, but this is often non-trivial to do. Opening the individual <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-xhtml-content-document">XHTML content document</a> [[epub-3]] in a browser
					and using the browser's markup inspection tools to review the calculated styles is the most reliable
					way to figure out font sizes. Reading systems do not typically provide this kind of information.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="identify-mathml">
				<h3>MathML markup</h3>

				<p>To check the <a href="#MathML"><code>MathML</code></a> feature for an EPUB 3 publication, open up the
						<a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-package-document">package document</a> and review the <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-manifest">manifest</a> [[epub-3]]. Any <a
						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-content-document">EPUB content document</a> [[epub-3]] that includes
					MathML [[mathml3]] markup has to have a <a data-cite="epub-3#attrdef-properties"
							><code>properties</code> attribute</a> [[epub-3]] that declares this is the case:</p>

				<pre>&lt;item id="c01" src="xhtml/chapter01.xhtml" … properties="mathml" /></pre>

				<p>If MathML is present but not declared, running EPUBCheck will cause an error to be reported.</p>

				<p>To manually check for MathML, every content document would have to be searched. MathML is typically
					enclosed in <code>math</code> tags like the following:</p>

				<pre>&lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/mathml">…&lt;/math></pre>

				<p>But because EPUB is XML-based, the <code>math</code> tag could also have a prefix, so could be tagged
					as <code>m:math</code> or <code>mml:math</code>. This kind of tagging is more common in legacy
					content when <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading systems</a> [[epub-3]] relied on
					the MathJAX application to render equations. Modern reading systems, like browsers, expect
					unprefixed elements as part of their support for HTML.</p>

				<p>Regardless of how the MathML markup is tagged, whether it is being used for <a href="#math">math
						equations</a> or <a href="#chemistry">chemical equations</a> needs to be determined so that the
					appropriate accessibility feature is flagged.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>MathML markup is not likely to be found in EPUB 2 publications. Although it could be added using
						the <code>epub:switch</code> element, reading systems never supported its rendering.</p>

				<p>To verify that open captions are being used, the [[html]] [^video^] element for the clip can be

				<p>Knowing the default direction is not enough on its own. Whether to set the <a href="#verticalWriting"

						data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a> [[epub-3]] does or does not include
					segmentation is to open it in a <a data-cite="epub-3#dfn-epub-reading-system">reading system</a>
					[[epub-3]] and visually inspect the content.</p>

				<p>Checking the markup may indicate if additional word segmentation is provided (e.g., if there are
						<code>span</code> elements around each group of characters to separate), but this kind of check
					is not reliable unless the CSS styling to add space is also easily verifiable.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Text with word spacing">
					<pre>&lt;p class="segmented-text">
   &lt;span>東京&lt;/span>&lt;span>に&lt;/span>&lt;span>行きます&lt;/span>。
&lt;/p></pre>

					<p>CSS styling to add a margin on the right:</p>

					<pre>.segmented-text > span {
  margin-right: 0.5em;
}</pre>
				</aside>
