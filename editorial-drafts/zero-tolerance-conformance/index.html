		<section id="abstract">
			<p>This document examines the impact of WCAG 2's zero-tolerance approach to accessibility, specifically as
				it affects the ability of publishers to certify that their EPUB Publications definitively contain no
				violations. The goal is to solicit feedback from the broader publishing community on the proposed
				approaches.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<section id="overview">
			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>Although the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [[WCAG2]] represent the most comprehensive and
				effective means of evaluating the accessibility of EPUB Publications, they do not allow any latitude for
				passing content that has even a single minor issue.</p>

			<p>While this all-or-nothing approach was designed to ensure content meets the highest possible standards,
				it also leaves publishers with the complex problem of certifying content fully meets WCAG requirements
				when any missed issue, no matter how severe, negates their claim.</p>

			<p>Given the size of most publications, and the workflows through which they are produced, it is often
				difficult to certify that not a single transgression has been missed. The complex mix of machine and
				human evaluation required to check any publication also leaves open the chance of errors slipping
				through.</p>

			<p>Despite this reality, publishers are often required to fully conform to [[WCAG2]]. If remediation of
				content may be necessary in some cases, making formal claims of complete conformance raises concerns
				about the possibility of legal action. The problem, then, is how to indicate that content conforms to
				the best of the publisher's knowledge and abilities.</p>

			<p>The purpose of this document is not to make a case that publishers should be given slack to willfully
				produce content with accessibility flaws, but to examine what options are available to address this more
				nuanced case of issues slipping through evaluation.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="approaches">
			<h2>Approaches</h2>

			<p class="note">This section summarizes the primary approaches to the zero-tolerance problem discussed by
				the Accessibility Task Force of the Publishing Community Group. To comment on these approaches, or
				propose an alternative, please add to the discussion in <a
					href="https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/22">issue 22</a> of the Community Group's
				tracker.</p>

			<section id="disclaimers">
				<h2>Add a Disclaimer</h2>

				<p>One option to address the possibility that a publisher might have missed some minor issues during an
					accessibility evaluation is to include a disclaimer in the EPUB Package Document metadata.</p>

				<p>To enable the embedding of these types of disclaimers, this document proposes a new
						<code>disclaimer</code> property in the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/#app-vocab-ref">EPUB accessibility properties
						namespace</a> [[EPUB-A11Y-11]]. The full definition of this property is provided in <a
						href="disclaimer"></a>.</p>

				<aside class="example">
					<p>The following example shows a disclaimer indicating how to report any issues.</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="dcterms:conformsTo"
    id="conf">
   EPUB-A11Y-11_WCAG-21-AA
&lt;/meta>
&lt;meta
    property="a11y:disclaimer"
    refines="#conf">
   Acme Publishing has checked this EPUB Publication for conformance to
   WCAG 2.1 Level AA to the best of our abilities. If you believe you have
   found a conformance issue we missed, please send a detailed message of
   the problem to accessibility@example.org
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p class="note">No changes are necessary to the EPUB specifications or epubcheck to use this property.
					Publishers interested in this approach are encouraged to experiment with its use and report on its
					utility to the Task Force.</p>

				<p>This property would be optional to include in the metadata but would allow the publisher to provide a
					clarifying statement that they have checked the EPUB Publication for conformance to the best of
					their abilities. The Accessibility Task Force is not proposing a boilerplate statement for all
					publishers to use with this property. Rather, publishers who want to make disclaimers are expected
					to craft the statements in consultation with their legal departments.</p>

				<p>Although the exact wording of the statement is at the publisher's discretion, the Task Force
					recommends publishers provide contact information for reporting failures to make it easier for users
					to provide feedback. The objective of a disclaimer is not to absolve the publisher of responsibility
					for issues that do slip through.</p>

				<p>The potential drawbacks of this approach are: 1) it may give the appearance that all publications
					that claim conformance contain errors; and 2) it may be abused by unscrupulous actors to claim
					conformance while not performing any detailed analysis of their content.</p>

				<p>The Task Force expects publishers to only use this property after performing thorough evaluation of
					their content or going through a thorough process of certifying the production processes, but there
					is no way to control how the metadata gets used. In environments where there are contractual and/or
					legal obligations to provide WCAG-conformant content, abuse of disclaimers will not provide cover
					for those misusing the property, so market forces will help curb some excesses.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="no-claim">
				<h2>Avoid Conformance Claims</h2>

				<p>Another potential approach to the problem is to not make a claim of conformance to the EPUB
					Accessibility specification [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] in an EPUB Publication. This would avoid the publisher
					having to state a specific level of WCAG conformance.</p>

				<p>Since that specification would no longer be followed, the author can omit adding a
						<code>dcterms:conformsTo</code> property. In its place, authors are recommended use the
						<code>a11y:certifierReport</code> property to link to a detailed report such as a VPAT. That
					report could detail the conformance, or lack thereof, with more context than would be possible in
					the EPUB Publication.</p>

				<aside class="example">
					<p>The following example shows a link to the certifier's report.</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="a11y:certifiedBy"
    id="cert">
   Acme Certifiers Inc.
&lt;/meta>
&lt;link
    rel="a11y:certifierReport"
    refines="#cert"
    href="reports/vpat.html"/></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>This approach offers no more certainty that errors have not have slipped through, but the author
					could make unofficial claims such as "substantively" conforming to [[WCAG2]] in their reports.</p>

				<p>Some potential drawbacks to this approach include:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Without a conformance claim, the publication may not register as accessible in vendor ingestion
						systems or in reading system processing. Users, in turn, would not be able to easily search for
						the publication.</li>
					<li>Users may not be able to access the information in a linked report, especially if the
						publication does not register as having been accessibility checked. Links to external web sites
						are not generally trustworthy, so vendors and reading systems may not provide access. Similarly
						displaying an embedded report is a potential security risk.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>

			<section id="discoverability-only">
				<h2>Add a New Discoverability Conformance Level</h2>

				<p>This option is similar to the <a href="#no-claim">preceding approach</a>, but adds a new conformance
					identifier to the EPUB Accessibility specification [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] that indicates the publisher has
					only met the discovery metadata requirements.</p>

				<aside class="example">
					<p>The following example shows a possible claim of discoverability.</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="dcterms:conformsTo"
    id="conf">
   EPUB-A11Y-11_DISCOVERABILITY
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>This approach would also rely on the publisher providing a link to a report to explain their actual
					conformance, or lack of, so has the same drawbacks as above. Its only advantage relative to that
					approach is that it disambiguates publications publishers have checked against the EPUB
					Accessibility specification from those they have not.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="wcag3">
				<h2>Wait for WCAG 3</h2>

				<p>The final option is to not try to solve this problem for [[WCAG2]] and wait on the development of
					WCAG 3, the next major version. It is expected that WCAG 3 will provide a scoring model for
					publications that will allow for some tolerance of minor issues. In this model, if issues are found
					after the fact, they would not necessarily invalidate the conformance claim if they are minor in
					nature.</p>

				<p>The obvious drawback of this approach is that relies on the current status quo being palatable to
					publishers until development of WCAG 3 is complete and its adoption widespread. The assumption here
					is that there is already a level of tolerance in the market for minor issues in content that claims
					conformance to [[WCAG2]] so publishers should not be overly concerned about their content being
					perfect.</p>
