	<section id="intro">
		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<section id="overview">
			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<p>Reading a digital publication is a very personal experience.
				For most people this is routine, and little
				consideration is given to how the title was obtained before
				it is read. Users may go to a bookstore or library,
				search for the title to purchase online, or have the title
				selected for them by an instructor for a
				class.</p>

			<p>Now consider that the person is blind and relies on assistive
				technology. The user needs that technology
				to assist them in the purchase process as well as to read
				the e-book. The person may wonder: will
				the screen reader work with this title; are there image
				descriptions that will be spoken to describe
				these images; are there page numbers which are accessible;
				is the reading order correct so a caution will be announced
				before reading the paragraph which could be dangerous? All
				of these accessibility concerns are potential issues
				consumers have when trying to purchase and ultimately read a
				digital publication in any format.</p>

			<p>The good news is more and more publishers are creating
				digital publications that are Born Accessible (i.e.,
				accessible from the outset, not fixed later) and getting the
				accessibility validation or audit done by
				independent organizations.</p>

			<p>These guidelines help those who wish to render accessibility
				metadata directly to users understand how to
				represent the accessibility claims inherent in
				machine-readable accessibility metadata in a
				user-friendly User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX). This
				document targets implementers such as
				bookstores, libraries, retailers, distributors etc. Content
				creators will benefit from reading these guidelines and
				are encouraged to follow <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB
					Accessibility 1.1
					Conformance and Discoverability Requirements section and
					its techniques.</a></p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>This document presents high-level guidelines without
					going into technical issues related to the
					different metadata standards in the publishing industry.
				</p>
				<p>Therefore, <a href="#techniques">techniques are
						available</a> that illustrate to developers how to
					retrieve data to show the information outlined in this
					document.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Metadata found either inside a digital publication or in a
				corresponding external record may have
				important accessibility claims that help end users find and
				determine if the publication can meet their
				specific accessibility needs.</p>

			<p>This accessibility metadata uses controlled vocabularies to
				allow it to be extracted and displayed uniformly across
				different publications and localized to different user
				interface languages. The one exception is the accessibility
				summary, which allows accessibility statements that are
				unique to a publication and that adds information not
				covered by other metadata entries.</p>

			<p>One important aspect is that the role of the Accessibility
				Summary metadata has changed in the latest
				version of the EPUB Accessibility specification, so a more
				in-depth analysis in the <a
					href="#accessibility-summary">Accessibility summary</a>
				section is recommended.</p>

			<p>This document offers guidance on how to aggregate and display
				claims inherent in metadata to end users;
				these are not strict guidelines, but suggestions for
				providing a consistent experience for users through
				different portals. Different implementers may choose to
				implement these guidelines in a slightly
				different way. Some examples can be seen in the <a
					href="#implementations">Implementations</a> section
				of the document.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="processing-guide">
			<h3>Metadata processing</h3>

			<p>The following diagram depicts how these guidelines relate
				to the format-specific techniques in the
				process of receiving and displaying accessibility
				metadata.</p>

			<img class="responsive" src="media/MetadataProcessing.png"
				aria-details="ecosystem"
				alt="Outline of the processing for EPUB, PDF, ONIX and MARC metadata. Description follows." />

			<div class="note">
				<p>Work on integrating PDF and MARC is ongoing. The
					diagram and text of this section will be updated
					in future versions as the related documents are
					finalized.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The diagram categorizes two ways that metadata
				accompanies a publication. In the first are digital
				publication formats that directly embed accessibility
				metadata (EPUB and PDF). In the second are
				external metadata record formats (ONIX and MARC) that
				accompany a digital publication as it moves
				through the supply chain.</p>

			<p>In some cases, a digital publication may include both
				internal and external metadata (e.g., an EPUB
				could have accessibility metadata in its package document
				and also be provided to a vendor with an
				ONIX record). In these cases, vendors and reading system
				developers determine for themselves which
				set of metadata they will use to display to users.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>This guide assumes the metadata is already in one of
					the formats described in the diagram, but
					depending on how the metadata is submitted it may
					need to be transformed. For example, if a vendor
					prefers to handle only ONIX metadata for display
					Then they would need to preprocess the metadata
					embedded in an EPUB or PDF to create the ONIX.</p>
				<p>The process of transforming metadata is not it scope
					for this document nor is how to reconcile
					metadata when it is provided in multiple forms. The
					guide assumes any processing has already
					occurred. For information on mapping between
					formats, refer to the <a
						href="https://w3c.github.io/publ-a11y/drafts/a11y-crosswalk-MARC/">Accessibility
						Properties
						Crosswalk</a>.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The next level of the diagram depicts the encoding
				standards expected for each format. This guide
				assumes that the metadata conforms to a recognized
				standard, otherwise it would be difficult to
				anticipate and process the incoming information for
				users:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For EPUB, the EPUB Accessibility standard
					[[epub-a11y-11]] defines required and recommended
					metadata for accessible publications. Guidance on
					applying this metadata is found in the EPUB
					Accessibility techniques [[epub-a11y-tech-11]].</li>
				<li>For ONIX, the accessibility characteristics of the
					corresponding digital publication are
					expressed using <a
						href="https://ns.editeur.org/onix/en">code
						lists</a> [[onix]], and guidance
					on applying these values is defined in the
					application note <a
						href="https://www.editeur.org/files/ONIX%203/APPNOTE%20Accessibility%20metadata%20in%20ONIX%20(advanced).pdf">Providing
						accessibility metadata in ONIX (advanced)</a>.
				</li>
				<li>For PDF, the PDF/UA standard
					[[iso14289-1]][[iso14289-2]] and <a
						href="https://pdfa.org/wtpdf/">Well-Tagged PDF
						guide</a> define how to describe accessibility
					metadata.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Knowing how the metadata is encoded and how it is
				expressed, the next stage of processing is to use
				the algorithms defined in the respective techniques
				documents to discover and translate the
				information into human-readable statements. These
				documents are intended primarily for developers,
				to help them with the specific processing of the
				metadata markup grammars.</p>

			<p>Finally, this document is shown at the last stage of
				processing, as it defines the purpose of each
				piece of metadata in more detail and prioritizes the
				display for readers.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="techniques">
			<h3>Display techniques</h3>

			<p>To assist developers in implementing these guidelines,
				in-depth notes are available to explain how to
				extract information from publishing industry metadata
				standards.</p>

			<p>At the time of publishing this document the available
				techniques for metadata standards are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/metadata-display-guide/techniques/epub/">Display Techniques for EPUB Accessibility Metadata 2.0</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/a11y/metadata-display-guide/techniques/onix/">Display Techniques for ONIX Accessibility Metadata 2.0</a></p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<div class="note">
				<p>Publishers update their ONIX records as needed. We
					expect "unknown" accessibility metadata may be
					initially provided but may change as more
					information becomes available. For this reason,
					implementors should be prepared to update the
					accessibility metadata as new ONIX feeds are made
					available.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section id="terminology">
			<h3>Terminology</h3>

			<p>There are several terms used in these guidelines that
				should be defined for clarity:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><dfn>digital publication</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The term digital publication is used in this
						document to refer to publications produced in
						any number of digital formats. Digital
						publications are not limited to books, but
						encompass any written, visual, or audio work
						distributed and read in digital form.</p>
					<p>Some examples of digital publications include
						ebooks, audiobooks, manga, comic books,
						journals, digital textbooks, picture books, and
						children's picture books with accompanying
						audio. The formats they come in include EPUB,
						PDF, and Digital Talking Books (DTB).</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><dfn>dynamic braille</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The term dynamic braille is used to denote
						content that is generated as braille on the fly,
						as opposed to preformatted digital braille
						formats. This dynamic rendering of
						content is sometimes referred to as electronic
						braille or refreshable braille.</p>

					<p>Dynamic braille is typically rendered on a
						separate device from the [=reading system=], one
						with
						pop-up pins to present the braille on a tactile
						screen. These devices, commonly referred to as
						refreshable braille displays, can be attached to
						a personal computer, or they may be a
						self-contained multipurpose note taker with a
						refreshable braille display.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><dfn>read aloud speech</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The term read aloud speech is used to denote
						content that is generated into synthetic speech
						on the fly, as opposed to prerecorded narration.
						Read aloud functionality is often a feature
						of [=reading systems=], but can be provided by a
						separate assistive technology.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><dfn>reading system</dfn></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>All [=digital publications=] require a reading system
						to present the publication to the end user.
						Reading Systems may be Apps that run on a smart
						phone or tablet. There are Reading Systems which
						are applications that run on personal computers.
						There are also Reading Systems that are
						integrated in to dedicated devices devoted to a
						single purpose, for presenting a publication.
						There are even skills that run on smart speakers
						that can be considered Reading Systems.</p>
				</dd>

	<section id="meta-display">
		<h2>Metadata display</h2>

		<section id="a11y-section">
			<h3>Accessibility section</h3>

			<section id="a11y-display-hd">
				<h4>Display heading</h4>

				<p>When presenting accessibility metadata provided by the
					publisher, it is suggested that the section is
					introduced using terms such as "claims" or
					"declarations" (e.g., "Accessibility Claims").</p>

				<p>The heading should clearly convey to
					the end user that the information comes directly from the
					publisher and represents the accessibility
					information that the publisher intends to communicate.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="rec-fields">
				<h4>Recommended display fields</h4>

				<p>There are several pieces of information that are central to describing the accessibility of a digital publication:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>People who need to adjust the visual presentation
						want to know if they can enlarge the text,
						which is essential for low vision users. People with
						dyslexia must be able to select the font
						and adjust the foreground, background, and line
						spacing and length. People with low vision or dyslexia
						represent the largest percentage of the
						print-disabled population.</li>

					<li>People who use a screen reader need to know if all the content in the title will be accessible to them. The text of the publication must be available for conversion to speech or braille. In addition, when images have text descriptions (alt text), indicating it in metadata will let users know that they will be not missing out on essential information. Blind users will greatly benefit from this information as will individuals who use the read aloud feature in reading systems.</li>

					<li>People who are selecting materials for public
						institutions such as libraries or schools need
						to know if the content conforms to accepted
						standards.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This is why these guidelines recommend that the following <a
						href="#a11y-display-fields">accessibility fields</a> should be
					displayed:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="#ways-of-reading">Ways of reading</a> &#8212; specifically the
						<a href="#visual-adjustments">visual adjustments</a>
						and <a href="#supports-nonvisual-reading">support for nonvisual reading</a> statements</li>
					<li><a href="#conformance-group">Conformance</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>The other metadata fields provide additional details about specific features or shortcomings in
					a publication. They give people the information they need to make an informed choice when selecting
					a particular digital publication.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="field-order">
				<h4>Display field order</h4>

				<p>Implementers can choose the order in which they prefer to display the <a
						href="#a11y-display-fields">accessibility metadata fields</a>.</p>

				<p>Moreover, although the metadata fields in this document are named, it is not required that
					implementers use these names as the field headings. Implementers can use alternative
					field names if they would make more sense in their display context.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="additional-a11y-meta">
				<h4>Additional accessibility metadata</h4>

				<p>Although this document showcases examples of important metadata that is expected to be present
					in a wide range of publications, available metadata schemas can support statements about many
					other features.</p>

				<p>The <a href="#techniques">techniques documents</a> describe how to output additional information not listed in this
					document. In addition, implementers may choose to display metadata that is not covered by
					this document or the techniques.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="missing-metadata">
				<h4>Missing metadata</h4>

				<p>When no accessibility metadata is provided by the publisher, it is best to
					avoid making a negative statement that could be attributed to them (e.g., stating
					it is not known if a feature is available could be misconstrued as the publisher
					saying they are unsure). The neutral statement "No information is available" is
					displayed for this case.</p>

				<p>In some cases, the distributor may not be allowed to show statements the publisher did not make.
					Hiding such sections is acceptable in these cases.</p>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section id="alt-statements">
			<h3>Alternative statements</h3>

			<p>Although the display statements listed in this document and in the <a href="#techniques">techniques
					documents</a> are recommended for use, and have been translated to support localization,
				implementors may prefer to use different wording in some situations.</p>

			<p>This document does not restrict implementers from using alternative phrasing, however
				any deviations should be done with caution. The phrases defined in this document resulted
				from much discussion among accessibility professionals as well as from user feedback.</p>

			<p>If the cause of alternative wording is due to translation issues, implementers are encouraged
				to <a href="https://github.com/w3c/publ-a11y/issues/">techniques documents</a> for correction.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="non-a11y-meta">
			<h3>Non-accessibility metadata</h3>

			<p>Not all metadata used in determining the accessibility of a publication is strictly categorized as
				accessibility metadata. The product details, for example, provide important information about the
				usability of an ebook in relation to specific user needs.</p>

			<p>In particular, the following information should always be displayed:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>File format (EPUB 2 or 3, PDF, MP3, Audiobook, etc.) &#8212;
					The file format gives a strong indication of
					accessibility: a PDF does not allow for typography
					modification, EPUB 2 is
					deprecated, an EPUB 3 support page navigation and
					better structural semantics; an MP3 format audiobook
					will be less structured than an Audiobook, etc.</li>

				<li>Protection measure or lack thereof &#8212; The
					protection measure may block assistive
					technologies such as screen readers. In addition,
					many specific eReading devices such as DAISY readers
					or Braille note takers are not equipped to read
					encrypted files.</li>

				<li>Name of the publishing house  &#8212; The name of the
					publishing house can highlight the
					efforts it has made in terms of
					accessibility.</li>

				<li>Main language of the content &#8212; The main language
					of the content enables readers to
					be confident that they will be able to read
					with their Assistive Technology that uses
					synthesized voice or the corresponding braille
					translation table
					for the language.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This metadata does not have to be included as part of the accessibility section; it only
				needs to be made available to users in the metadata display for a publication.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section id="a11y-display-fields">
		<h2>Accessibility display fields</h2>

		<section id="ways-of-reading">

			<div class="note">
				<p>This display field should be rendered even

			<p> Navigating a digital publication through a table of

				shortcuts is important to allow the user to easily
				access each part of the digital publication. These
				features are
				both essential for accessibility and important for all
				users reading publications. Therefore,
				clearly communicating to the user what navigation
				features are available in the publication is
				important to enable proper title selection.</p>

			<p>Note that the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
				2.1 standard requires that <q>more than one
					way is available to locate a Web page within a set
					of Web pages</q> (<cite><a

						Criterion 2.4.5 Multiple
						Ways</a></cite>).</p>
<div class="note"><p>While not required if available, it may be helpful to identify the bibliographic information about the page break source identified in metadata of the digital publication. Having sufficient information to identify the print source would assure students and educators that the digital version they are using is correctly associated with the print version used in the classroom. The goal is to have the go to page function take the digital user to the same page as the print version user.

			<p>In some jurisdictions publishers may be able to claim an
				exemption from the provision of accessible
				publications, including the provision of accessibility
				metadata. This should always be subject to
				clarification by legal counsel for each jurisdiction.
				One example of this, at time of writing, is
				from the European Accessibility Act (EAA) when the
				publisher is a micro-enterprise (i.e.,
				enterprises employing fewer than 10 people and with
				annual turnover or balance sheet total not
				exceeding 2 million euro).</p>
			<p>Other legal considerations currently included in the EAA
				may include exceptions on individual
				versions of a title, where jurisdiction will not require
				the title to be accessible if it involves a
				fundamental alteration of the content, or if making it
				accessible would place a disproportionate
				burden on the publisher. (This may vary in other
				jurisdictions).</p>

			<p>Publishers may need to include information about an
				exemption or exception in metadata for legal or
				clarity reasons, either to bodies that enforce
				legislation or for other business to business
				communication. However this is not information that
				needs to be displayed on public sites as it does
				not mean anything to most consumers and could lead to
				misunderstandings. Nevertheless, the objective

		<h2>Discovering accessible content</h2>

		<p>The guidelines for presenting accessibility metadata detailed
			in this document are intended to improve
			the user experience when readers browse the catalogue entry
			for a publication. However, accessibility
			metadata also has a vital role to play in helping readers
			discover publications that are accessible to
			them.</p>

		<p>Publication providers, such as vendors and libraries create
			searching and filtering tools that interpret
			accessibility metadata to aid in discovery. The set and
			variety of filters depend on the public they
			address and the type of book they propose. </p>

		<p>User feedback indicates that in the absence of specific
			accessibility filters, they find product details
			like file format and protection measures (e.g., digital
			rights management) crucial information in
			determining usability.</p>

		<p>Taking into consideration those realities, the following
			sections propose a minimum and an extended set
			for filtering options. Mostly any specific information could
			be added if considered of use for the

			<h3>Minimum filtering set</h3>

			<p> Reading systems, commerce, and distribution platforms
				will typically have specific filtering
				options; having uniformity for key aspects and providing
				guidance for a standardized approach can
				help the discovery process for users searching for
				relevant titles. Accomplishing this, however,
				should not prevent users with specific reading needs
				from finding books they are looking for. To
				achieve this goal, it is recommended that all platforms
				present two minimum capabilities, centered
				around the ways of consuming the content. These are:</p>

			<ol>
<li>Titles that support visual adjustments</li>
				<li>Titles that support nonvisual reading</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Of note, only the positive values should be used.</p>
<div class="note"><p>It is recommended to filter on the original accessibility metadata values. The strings presented to the user for filtering may draw from the user-facing strings.</p></div>

					<li>Support for Nonvisual Reading</li>
					<li>Supports Visual Adjustments</li>
				</ul>
			</aside>

		<section id="extended-filtering-set">
			<h3>Extended filtering set</h3>

			<p> In specific domains, the addition of other options will
				be important to help users find content
				that responds to a particular need or scenario. Each
				domain case would drive the selection
				of appropriate items. Some examples of these domains
				(not exclusive) are:</p>

			<ul>
				<li> In an academic context, the presence of printed
					page numbers may be crucial to make sure the
					reader will be able to find or make a citation.
				</li>
				<li> In a technical or scientific context, information about access rich content like charts, diagrams, figures, graphs, math, and chemical formulas will be important.</li>
				<li> In markets where compliance to legislation is
					required, understanding conformance information may be mandatory. </li>
				<li> Platforms dedicated to selling children's books and
					interactive content may want to allow users
					to select books with no hazards or inform them about
					the presence of prerecorded audio. </li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="example" title="Extended filtering options">
				<ul>
					<li>Go to page</li>
					<li>Math as MathML</li>
					<li>Information-rich images are described by extended descriptions</li>
					<li>This publication meets accepted accessibility standards</li>
						<li>No hazards</li>

		<h2>Localization</h2>

		<p>
			An ebook can be purchased in any country  and be made available through a distributor or a library.
			Readers want consistent display of accessibility
			information that spans multiple languages, and that’s the primary role of this display
			guide.
			The wording of information provided to users proposed in this guide has been widely discussed
			by a large group representing different
			people in the English-speaking language group. The language has been
			improved after proof-of-concept translations
			and reviewed by panels of testers in several countries. </p>

		<p>
			It is understood that different countries or different target
			audience services may want to use specific language, and we
			have provided flexibility in the guide to accommodate this requirement. Simply translating the strings is not enough; the subtle
			meaning of the words and phrases of accessibility concepts
			must be localized for maximum understanding. Therefore, a mechanism is being provided for the publishing community
			to collaboratively deliver translations that localizes the strings for
			equally effective communication in any language. It is hoped that the localization area will become the defacto hub for development and distribution of language packs for each language and regional variation.</p>

			<h3>Localization strategy</h3>

			<p>
				With the rapidly evolving landscape of accessible ebooks
				available, most concerned persons are discovering a new
				world. To ensure the information is widely spread and
				understood, the implementation by local actors like
				libraries serving persons with disabilities and other
				local actors in the fight to end the book famine for
				readers with print disabilities is crucial and should be
				highlighted.
			</p>
			<p>
				The localization of the display guide is a good
				opportunity to make known the rich accessibility
				features offered by modern formats like EPUB. In
				addition, having a local project scale to write an
				understandable vocabulary to describe such features is a
				precious qualitative approach that will benefit every
				player in the value chain.
			</p>
			<p>
				To build a local project and facilitate feedback
				comparisons, you can use open source methodology,
				resources, and prototypes published by EDRLab for the
				original <a
					href="https://edition-accessible.github.io/signalement/en/index-en.html">Signposting
					accessible digital books project</a> that led to the
				initial <a
					href="https://edition-accessible.github.io/signalement/documents/EDRLab-Signalement_lettreW3C_EN.pdf">Feedback
					letter (PDF)</a> addressed in early 2022, and has
				already been used and adapted in various places.
			</p>
			<p>
				In these projects, emphasis was placed on the
				implications for the end users. For instance, the French
				wording proposed by EDRLab resulted from a quantitative
				survey of different reader groups, carefully selected
				panels of individual observations, and an extended
				feedback process through a dedicated formula available
				on the 140 first implementation platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, companies like VitalSource that need wide
				localization have offered to open-source their
				professional translation work, which has produced the
				needed quantity and that is better to use than nothing
				when no national project has issued a handcrafted
				vocabulary.
			</p>
			<p>
				To reconcile both sources of provided localization
				materials, we propose a collection mechanism based on a
				detailed identification of the provenance. Because
				persons and organizations with different levels of
				technicality must be able to contribute, we accept
				raw files via Pull requests.
			</p>

		<section>
			<h3 id="How-to-contribute">How to contribute?</h3>
			<p>First let us know as soon as possible that you are
				working on a localization and wish to submit it. That
				allows us to prepare a placeholder for your work. This
				is not mandatory but we invite you to contact the group
				and participate to a regular call of the working group
				as those are open to anyone. </p>
			<p>When you are ready to publish your work, two options are
				possible:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you don’t know what a JSON or a Pull Request is,
					you are welcome to contact us.</li>
				<li>If you feel technically ready or have a collaborator
					that can push a pull request, the process is to
					duplicate the canonical original file
					UX-Guide-Metadata/draft/localizations/en-US/display_guide_vocabulary_w3c_en-US.json,
					modify it by changing the values in front of each
					key, and open a pull request so we can review it.
					Please be aware that we could have questions or ask
					for precision in the process before accepting and
					merging your contribution.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="How-to-choose-between-localization-files">How to
				choose between localization files?</h3>

			<p>The first keys of each JSON files contains descriptive
				information about it, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Author, name of the organisation responsible for the
					establishment and maintenance of this localization
				</li>
				<li>Language, is a 4 letters code where the two first
					letters specifies the language as per ISO 639-1 and
					the two others the country as per ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
				</li>
				<li>Variant, a one word free name to identify your work
				</li>
				<li>Audience describes the public. We recommend to use
					any vocabulary from the <a
						href="https://ns.editeur.org/onix/en/28/">ONIX
						list 28</a>. More than one audience can be
					informed with a comma separating each.</li>
				<li>Description, a free field including a short
