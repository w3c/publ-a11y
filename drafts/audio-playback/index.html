			<p>This guide provides a brief introduction to the different types of audio playback typically found in
				publications. It covers the differences between the types of audio publications created by publishers
				and audio playback automatically generated by user agents. It also explains how screen readers and other
				Assistive Technologies (AT) produce audio through Text-to-Speech (TTS), which often blurs the lines
				between a prepared title designed for audio consumption and a text-based title that readers can consume
				using audio through Assistive Technologies.</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>Publishing has a sometimes-dizzying array of ways of referring to audio playback &#8212; audiobook,
				talking book, read aloud book, text-to-speech playback, media overlays and full audio are some of the
				most common terms.</p>

			<p>Compounding the confusion is that these are often all referred to as audio books (two words), even though
				there is a unique form of publication called an audiobook (one word). Moreover, Text-To-Speech synthesis
				is often talked about as though it is an audio format even though it is a feature of the device or the
				Assistive Technology a reader is using.</p>

			<p>Despite the many terms used to describe audio playback, there are only two primary models for classifying
				publications with recorded audio:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Audiobook</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A publication whose primary, and typically only, way of being read is auditorily.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Full Audio</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The content of a publication is available in auditory form, but the audio is often structured
						together with textual or visual content.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>Slightly tangential to these models, but equally important, is Text-To-Speech synthesis. Speech synthesis
				is not technically a form of audio playback but a way to have the device a reader is using synthetically
				voice the text content of a publication. Speech synthesis is like an on-demand rendering of content in
				this way, but due to the limitations of text-to-speech rendering engines the result is often not as
				precise and clear as professional human narration.</p>

			<p>The rest of this guide explores each of these technologies in more detail and demystifies the terminology
				used to describe them.</p>

			<h2>Audiobooks</h2>

			<p>An audiobook provides prerecorded narration of a work. Publishers typically structure audiobooks as a
				series of one or more audio files that readers will listen to in sequence.</p>

			<p>Readers may stream the audio directly from an audiobook publisher, like Audible, or may obtain a set of
				audio files that they can play back on any device or application with audio playback capabilities.</p>

			<p>The key feature of an audiobook is that it is designed to be listened to. If there is any text content,
				it is typically quite minimal (e.g., a playlist to aid in playback on specific devices or a table of
				contents).</p>

			<p>A recent W3C standard, aptly named <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">Audiobooks</a>, seeks to
				bring greater structure to the world of audiobooks by introducing a formal syntax for describing
				audiobook metadata, listing the resources of the book, and defining a play order, among other
				features.</p>

			<p class="note">Although audiobooks have historically been referred to as talking books, the term "talking
				book" is now more commonly associated with DAISY Digital Talking Books. These are a hybrid between
				audiobooks and full audio publications that are designed for readers who are blind, have low vision, or
				other print disabilities, such as dyslexia.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="full-audio">
			<h2>Full Audio Publications</h2>

			<p>A publication with full audio differs from an audiobook in that formats that allow full audio content
				also allow the inclusion of, and synchronization with, the full text content (even if the full text is
				not always available).</p>

			<p>EPUB is an example of a format that allows publishers to include full audio. Although EPUB is a
				text-first format, it includes a technology called Media Overlays that allows publishers to synchronize
				audio with the text for automatic playback.</p>

			<p>Some Reading Systems will omit the text, making it appear as though an EPUB is an audiobook, but, unlike
				audiobooks, there is always a minimal amount of text that publishers must provide. Publications with
				full audio are never as simple to load and play as pure audiobooks are because there are control files
				that a simple audio playback device does not understand.</p>

			<p>Full audio publications are often referred to as "<dfn>read aloud books</dfn>" because publishers
				commonly use synchronized text and audio playback in children's works. Children can follow the text as
				the Reading System plays back the audio.</p>

			<h2>Text-To-Speech Synthesis</h2>

			<p>Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis is a form of audio rendering typically produced on demand by a Reading
				System or Assistive Technology. VoiceOver on Apple devices and Talkback on Android are a couple of the
				more commonly known examples of TTS engines built into mainstream phones and tablets, while Jaws and
				NVDA are examples of Assistive Technologies that can translate text to speech for users who need an
				auditory interface to their Windows computers.</p>

			<p>Text-To-Speech synthesis is commonly associated with users who are blind, but many readers benefit from
				being able to render text content auditorily using Text-To-Speech synthesis. Even sighted readers will
				turn to speech synthesis when it is not conducive to read content visually (e.g., when in a moving
				vehicle). Many Reading Systems are now providing TTS rendering as a function in the application. </p>

			<p>Unlike audiobooks and publications with full audio, however, Text-To-Speech synthesis is not an audio
				format. It is a way of listening to text content the reader has already obtained. Readers can use a TTS
				application to read their EPUB publications.</p>

			<div class="note">
				<p>The names some reading systems give their Text-to-Speech playback feature can be confusingly similar
					to "<a>read aloud books</a>". For example, a button named "Read Now" might initiate Text-to-Speech
					playback. The distinguishing feature between the two is that Text-to-Speech playback employs
					on-the-fly voice synthesizing.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The applications that provide Text-To-Speech synthesis for persons with disabilities are usually not
				specifically designed for reading publications, however. They are general tools that aid navigation
				across the device the reader is using and any other apps and content that are on it. As a result, they
				often only have a very limited built-in vocabulary of pronunciations so are not able to provide a
				similar quality of playback as prerecorded human narration.</p>

			<p>When a user enables Text-To-Speech playback, the Reading System or Assistive Technology feeds the text
				content of the publication to an underlying TTS engine that voices each word. For most general language,
				the rendering returned is reasonably good, but the engines will struggle with works that contain complex
				terms, jargon, uncommon names, etc. Readers consequently also typically have the option to have
				individual words spelled out, both to help disambiguate similar-sounding words and to make sense of
				complex words and heteronyms (words spelled the same but with different pronunciations) that
				Text-to-Speech engines mispronounce. This ability to explore the spelling of words, which readers cannot
				do with human narrated titles, is a particular advantage of Text-To-Speech synthesis. </p>

			<p>Although Text-To-Speech synthesis is not audio playback provided by the publisher, it is sometimes
				possible for publishers to help improve the quality of the rendering. Technologies such as the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)</a> and <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/">Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS)</a>
				allow publishers to provide the proper phonetic pronunciation of complex words and heteronyms.
				Unfortunately, support for these technologies is not yet widespread.</p>

			<p>Text-To-Speech synthesis provides a reasonable alternative to audio playback formats and allows readers
				to speed up playback to high rates. In addition, readers can also synchronize Text-To-Speech playback
				with refreshable braille displays. However, Text-To-Speech remains an imperfect means of reading
				publications, especially when compared to the wonderful talented narrators that produce audio books.</p>
