				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>Providing navigation to static page break markers is a key accessibility feature for digital
					publications that are used in both print and digital formats in the same environment (e.g.,
					classrooms). But without a means of identifying what edition of a static work the page navigation
					corresponds to, it is impossible for users to determine if the publication will be sufficient for
					their needs. For example, if a class uses a softcover edition of a book and the EPUB publication
					pagination corresponds to the hardcover, digital users will not be able to access the same page
					break locations.</p>

				<p>How to identify the source of pagination has been a continuing problem in the EPUB 3 metadata. The
					original idea was to use a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-opf-dcmes-optional-def"
							><code>dc:source</code> element</a> [[epub-3]] to specify the pagination. This method proved
					unreliable both for machine verification that the EPUB creator had set the method and to extract and
					present the information to users. Publishers sometimes specify multiple sources for their
					publications in multiple <code>dc:source</code> elements, making it impossible for a machine to
					determine which identifies the source.</p>

				<p>To address this problem, the specification then introduced a "<a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#attrdef-refines">refinement</a>" [[epub-3]] property called <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#sec-source-of"><code>source-of</code></a> [[epub-3]] whose
					only purpose was to indicate which <code>dc:source</code> property identified the source.</p>

				<p>Since its addition, however, two additional problems have surfaced with this approach:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>It was defined in a way that makes it unique to EPUB 3's metadata format. When the
							<code>refines</code> attribute was nearly dropped in EPUB 3.1, it exposed that there was
						still no other way to express this information. Consequently, future formats cannot rely on the
							<code>source-of</code> property.</li>
					<li>Relying on <code>dc:source</code> confuses how to state that a digital-only publication does not
						have a source for its markers. EPUB creators have resorted to identifying the current
						publication as the source of itself or saying that the publication has a source of nothing for
						the pagination, neither of which makes much sense logically and are at best hacks of the
						metadata. Omitting a <code>dc:source</code>, while accurate in this situation, makes validation
						difficult as it cannot be determined whether the EPUB creator simply forgot to specify the
						source.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The <code>pageBreakSource</code> property proposed in this document is intended to provide a simple
					and reliable solution to these problems moving forward.</p>

				<h3>Definition</h3>

				<table class="tabledef">
					<tr>
						<th>Name:</th>
						<td>
							<code>pageBreakSource</code>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Description:</th>
						<td>
							<p>Provides a unique identifier for the source of the page break markers in an <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub/#dfn-epub-publication">EPUB publication</a>.</p>
							<p>The identifier should be expressed as a URN when the value conforms to a recognized
								scheme such as an ISBN.</p>
							<p>If a unique identifier does not exist for the source, EPUB creators should use a text
								description that identifies the source as clearly as possible (e.g., the title of a word
								processing document).</p>
							<p>If the page break markers are unique to the EPUB publication (e.g., for a digital-only
								edition), EPUB creators MUST specify the value "<code>none</code>".</p>
						</td>

						<th>Allowed value(s):</th>

							<code>xsd:string</code>

						<th>Cardinality:</th>
						<td>Exactly one when the publication includes a page list and/or page break markers, otherwise

				<h3>Examples</h3>

				<aside class="example" title="Pagination from a source with a unique identifier">
					<p>In this example, the pagination corresponds to a print edition with an ISBN number. A URN is used
						to identify the scheme the number conforms to.</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="pageBreakSource">
   urn:isbn:9780010010001
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<aside class="example" title="Pagination without a source">
					<p>In this example, the publisher has added the page break markers and page list for a digital-only
						edition. The value <code>none</code> indicates that the pagination is not drawn from another
						source.</p>
					<pre>&lt;meta
    property="pageBreakSource">
   none
&lt;/meta></pre>
				</aside>

				<aside class="example" title="Pagination from a source without a unique identifier">
					<p>In this example, the name of the document and its format are used to identify the source of the
						pagination.</p>
