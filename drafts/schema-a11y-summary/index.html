			<p>The Accessibility Summary's name is somewhat misleading. It is not intended to be a comprehensive  summary, but it should add additional information, clarifications,  and refinements to the other accessibility metadata. In creating the Accessibility Summary, one should assume that the other accessibility metadata has already been presented, and the Accessibility Summary serves to enhance the metadata. If there are features or shortcomings in the publication that is not expressed in other accessibility metadata, then the Accessibility Summary is the correct place to include this information. The remainder of these guidelines explains some considerations, and provides some examples of Accessibility Summaries.</p>

		<section id="introduction">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility Conformance and
					Discovery Specification defines a schema.org metadata term called "accessibilitySummary."</a> This
				piece of metadata is  important in that it provides   additional accessibility information or refines the accessibility metadata provided by other fields. Online Library and retail catalogues should present the accessibility metadata and the accessibilitySummary to
				assist in making the decision to select a title.  Selection of content should include accessibility considerations of products.</p>

			<p class="note">Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/09/UX-Guide-metadata-1.0/principles/">User
					Experience Guide for Displaying Accessibility Metadata 1.0</a> for libraries and retailers.</p>
			<p class="note">Please note that the accessibility summary is written from the perspective of the content provider 
				and some features and functions will vary depending on the reading system or
				the environment the end user is operating within.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="before-writing">
			<h2>Before you start writing</h2>

			<p>The <a href="https://daisy.github.io/ace/">Accessibility Checker for EPUB (Ace by DAISY)</a> is a tool
				which can be used to help you determine some of the accessibility features within the publication.  This will help you determine
				what should be included in the accessibilitySummary.</p>

			<p>Next read the accessibility metadata in the EPUB package.opf file before you begin to write. Make note of
				the features listed in the metadata as you prepare to write. One should always truthfully represent the
				accessibility of the publication and point out shortcomings of the publication; students may be able to
				get assistance from their school or university if some aspects of the publication are not accessible.
				For example, if complex graphics that convey information do not have an extended description, let people
				know that extended descriptions are not available.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="high-level-considerations">
			<h2>Some High-Level Considerations</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>There should only be one accessibility summary. Do not include multiple accessibility summaries in
					different languages.</li>
				<li>The language of the accessibility summary should be in the primary language of the publication. For
					example, a publication in French should have the accessibility summary also in French. While some
					publications may have many passages in another language, the primary language should be determined.
					For example, a publication intended to teach Spanish to English speaking students would have the
					primary language as English.</li>
				<li>Ensure the language of the accessibility summary is declared in the metadata.</li>
				<li>It should be noted that markup in metadata is not allowed. While it may be tempting to use headings, bullets, bold, or  other markup, this must not be used.</li>

				<li>Use simple language that communicates effectively to a non-technical and a non-accessibility aware
					community.</li>
				<li>Avoid terms that are only known in a specific knowledge domain, or explain the term in a simple
					way.</li>
					<li>The use of jargon or language that is not commonly understood should be avoided. It is better to explain what is meant. </li>

					
				<li>Write out the words of the acronym before using the abbreviation, e.g. Web Content Accessibility
					Guidelines (WCAG).</li>
				
				<li>The length of the Accessibility Summary is important. Ideally the accessibilitySummary should be
					under 500 characters in
					length. The ONIX guideline suggests less than 500 characters. </li>
				<li>The Accessibility Summary should be succinct and place the most essential information at the
					beginning. We have no way of knowing how many characters various systems will display, and it is
					possible that the Accessibility Summary would be truncated after a system-dependent number of characters.
					Also, we believe people will be reading quickly and if the Accessibility Summary is long, people may
					read only the beginning section.</li>
				<li>If content of a similar type goes through the same workflow and quality assurance process, the same accessabilitySummary may be reused.  However, make sure that the <code>accessibilitySummary</code> metadata that ships with the
					publication is accurate and applies to this particular publication.</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="what-to-include">
			<h2>What to Include in the <code>AccessibilitySummary</code></h2>

			<p>Here is a list of areas that the summary should address :</p>

			<section id="accessibility-conformance">
				<h3>Accessibility Conformance Related Statements</h3>

				<p>The group of conformance statements are listed below. The level of conformance should be identified
					such as AA or A. There is also the possibility of referencing conformance to an "optomized"
					specification, which might not meet WCAG guidelines, such as an audio only specification. It is
					possible for the publisher to self-certify and not having third party certification should be noted.
					It has been brought up that WCAG A and AA conformance is a difficult or impossible claim to make,
					and will be addressed in WCAG 3.0. For this reason, some organizations plan to qualify their claim
					by saying, "as far as we know" or "it strives to" in their statement. The suggested summary below
					contains this language.</p>

				<table class="zebra">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Accessibility Metadata</th>
							<th>Priority</th>
							<th>Suggested summary</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Conformance statement </td>
							<td>1</td>

							<td>Credentials of certifier</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>XYZ certifiers is endorsed by the certifiers guild.</td>
						</tr>

				<h3>Accessibility Features</h3>
<p>Features that have been included in metadata may benefit from additional information that more clearly explains the feature.  Some examples have been provided in the table below.</p>

<p>For a complete list of features see: <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/a11y-discov-vocab/latest/#accessibilityFeature">Schema.org Accessibility Properties for Discoverability Vocabulary</a></p>

							</br>
							The tables are represented as images, and the full text of the table is provided below the image within the details element, which can be expanded.</td>
							<td>Sometimes contented is formatted in such a way that it cannot be reflowed or other features cannot be adjusted.

							<td>Extended descriptions: Extended (or long) descriptions are used when complex graphics or
								other highly visual components convey information. The extended description communicates
								the equivalent information through text, tables, etc. The technique for providing the description should be included, such as in a details element or through a link to another part of the book with a link back to the exact spot.</td>

							<td><em>longDescription</em> is missing</td>
							
							<td>This publication contains graphical content that conveys significant information. This

				<h3>Accessibility Hazards</h3>

				<p>Accessibility hazards: Some content, especially videos, may contain elements that have been found to
					be problematic. Most common items are motion effects that make some people motion sick, flashing
					that can cause severe distractions or even seizures, or loud sharp noises like a gunshot which can
					cause hearing issues. It is only necessary to include this information if more information about the hazard is wanted to be communicated. </p>
<p>If available, specific information about the hazard should be provided. The specific information will help to determine if the content is suitable for people with certain conditions.  It is also advisable to explain if by not watching the video or other content is essential to the understanding of the content. For example, watching a video of a rollercoaster may cause motion sickness, but the video is not essential to understanding of the material. It is also suggested that the location of the hazard be provided to enable the reader to avoid that content. If there are multiple hazards, each instance should be explained.</p>



<p>For example, “This publication contains a motion hazard in chapter 8 page 202. There is a video showing a rollercoaster going up and down rapidly. Watching the video is interesting, but not essential for understanding the concept of elevation loss and gain.”</p>
